Tpeculary leap in "Wingen" over Bogota
The sportsman, Jhonathan Florz, slandered on Thursday of a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped from a wingen (a combination of love), he went to 160 km / h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located over 3 000 meters of altitude, where many badaders had gathered to observe his feat.
A black box in your car?
While the US road network planners find it hard to find the money to repair the decrepitated motorway infrastructure, many are finding a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the car scoreboards.
The appliances, recording all the miles travelled by a driver and passing on information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main American roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of major axes suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmentalists in pressing for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles that you are parting, and possibly on the road you are circulating, and then using the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landing.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And, while congressmen are unable to reach agreement on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they can switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system for an experimental vivid.
This is really essential for our nation.
It is not as if we had the choice, declared Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of the Southern California Association of Governance, that the state is beginning to record the miles travelled by every Californian driver by 2025.
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do this.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay for the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as before.
Vehicles can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase taxes, even 1%, while petrol prices are high.
The petrol tax is simply not tenable, as Lee Mternich has said, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently installed traces of 500 cars to test a mine payment system.
This is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long term, he said.
Wonks call this the cost of using mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea of the liberals is seductive, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California's planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious laws on global warming.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the House of Representatives, said that he considered it as the most viable alternative in the long term.
Opponents of the Reagan Foundation's free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for it.
It is not just a tax that engages in a large black hole, as Addrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reasa policy, has said.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are given.
The movement is also supported by two former US Secretaries in Transports which, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go down the road to a mine payment.
The US Senate approved a $90-M pilot project last year that would have been about 10 000 cars.
But the presidency of the House has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or city.
Several states and cities are nevertheless making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5 000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the price of a kilometric charge instead of petrol taxes.
The Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is looking at one.
Illinois is trying to test a limited number of lorries.
And coalition I-95, comprising 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the US coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how it can implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In the Nevada, where some 50 voluntary motorists recently fitted their cars with an appliance, drivers were worried that the government could follow their little facts and gestures.
The concerns about Big Brother and this sort of thing are a major problem, as Alauddin Khan, who is leading the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transport Department, has said.
That is not something that people want.
From the start of the trial, the Nevada's ACU warned about its location: it would be relatively easy to transform these appliances into fully-fledged localisation devices.
There is no need to build a huge and congested technological infrastructure that will inevitably be widened to keep records of people's everyday lives and everyday lives.
The Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles short of a car, but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do that, then Kan, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up of California in the name of Tue Mileage.
Originally, society was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to the Member States.
It sought to penetrate the emerging market in self-insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their kilometre.
But the appliances that it tested planted planners of major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited quantity of information, periodically downloaded by mom.
People will be more inclined to do this if you do not record their speed and do not locate them, declared Ryan Morrison, the Director General of Tue Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of certain States.
There are much cheaper ways of doing things and far less intrusive methods.
In Oregon, planners try to experiment by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a machine with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any apparatus at all, preferring instead instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing appliances to do more, rather than not enough.
In the city of New York, transport officials seek to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for parking costs, provide insurance payments for driving, and create a set of data on real-time speed from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid congestion.
The motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them, and has indicated a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole debate on mine payment is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the San Francisco Bay area, officials say that Congress could quite simply manage the Highway Trust Fund's bankruptcy by increasing taxes on gasoline.
A single or extra annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume a great deal, so that everyone pays their fair share.
There is no need to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin, as Mrs Rmentscher, the Director of the Law and Public Affairs of the Committee, said.
If that is done, hundreds of millions of motorists will be worried about the protection of their privacy and a host of other things.
David Bowe: four Innovations
The English musician has not finished this year.
From the Next Day, which appeared in January, he concocted a luxury replenishment planned for 4 November, with several news stories.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in the vanguard.
On the day of his 66th birthday, on 8 January 2013, he said that a new album would emerge in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Realty, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician demonstrated that you could still count on him to divide the pop.
A festival for his fans
Not as a result of surprises, David Bowe had more in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has thus planned to rewrite this album on 4 November.
For the time being he concocted a real festival for his fans.
This republication, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, the unusual session sessions and the remixs, as well as a DVD containing the four clicks already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional headings in relation to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxis edition, five songs specifically unveiled for the occasion, and two wounds.
Indeed, David Bowe made presentations of this beautiful coffin in a video.
It introduces both the discounts, but also the accessories with: exclusive photographs and patchwork, a carnet to share its own impressions, a revelation with words...
And, above all, he gives a foretaste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very advanced guides and rock-bottom rock electricity.
Innovations that are already in the offing
But Atomica is not the only title to disclose his weapons.
The Informing, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFOO, is also available on the web.
The Informing is twofold: a worrying trainer before a luminate cavalcade that is gradually slowing down to allow a pop bullet.
On Like A Rocket Man, he wanted to make a small reference to the Rocket Man Elton John, or even to Gavity?
With this title, the singer seems in any case to be in his or her own corner when he has no feet on the ground.
Spice Odty, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowe once again refers to his strangers: would he come from another planet?
Witness riffers, stunning, give the world an incentive to leave the Earth.
Bowe, in any case, is amusing a camera with these titles: informally, man on the verge of a rocket, a marvellous potential...
It conceals and reveals both that it is playing different personalities, as it has done throughout its career, particularly with its characters Zigy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
So it is no wonder that he has a mouthpiece in the photograph of the Village in Vyage, the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
Defense Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attached by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr Nicholson assured us that, before they were released, the army members were following a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All the injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Critics blame the government for wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not respond to the rule of the army's "universality of service," demanding that staff be able to carry out a range of different tasks - to reach the 10-year qualifying period for pension benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Presevo Cadiz, including a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist, in Ontario, reached post-traumatic stress syndrome, has been released from the army despite his request to remain a year more so that he can receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirchester, who said in a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not comply with the rule of universality of the service.
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared, with plans and consultation meetings, but that this was completely different from the fact that he wanted to leave the ranks.
"I told them that I was not ready," he said during a meeting with the Presevo Canadise on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine how much latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the ranks, but who are not capable of fighting.
Under current rules, the injured soldiers have been injured for up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they can be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service required to obtain pension benefits.
The liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this disgraceful practice."
Disney set up to launch a lively series of events.
The American media and entertainment group has decided to give priority to the tablets in its own television channels for the next round of children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callium WWild West will be available from 24 November on the Watchdisneyjunior.com site or via its application for telephones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney Group's channels is planned only in 2014, details the communiqué of its Disney Junior division.
The vivid cartoon for children aged between 2 and 7 tells the adventures of the Callian chatter, the sheriff of a city in the West, where it reigns the order with a magical laso.
Each episode comprises two histories of 11 minutes.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," Albert Cheng, Vice-President responsible for digital products at Disney / ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqué.
This kind of experience in the efforts of Disney to "extend the life span of its series and build new relationships with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the less than two years old have already served a tank or telephone, and 72% of the less than eight years, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the whistleblowers of US intelligence, said that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if America's National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter which the honourable Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: 'Although the outcome of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the case of the complaint lodged by the US Department of Justice, he is accused of spying and theft of state goods.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Minister for the Interior, said in Zeit Online: if Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German officials, we will make sure that we do that.
Relations between the US and Germany have been severely tested following complaints that the NSA had tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Ophotn, the Member who heads the parliamentary group supervising the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr Snowden as a witness, without putting it at risk and completely ruining relations with the United States, we had to take advantage of this.
Mr Stöbele, a German Green MEP, published a photograph with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Straöbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be safe there, as the Member said.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he was the subject of a serious and sustained persecution campaign which forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global reaction to my act of political expression.
Citizens throughout the world, as well as senior officials, including those in the United States, found that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
The letter puts forward a offer of cooperation with the German authorities when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive television.
Cogeco Cables's subscribers may have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter, and, last but not least, video service on request Netflix via their television in a future that does not seem so far away.
The subsidiary of Cogeco indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the Betera version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options," explained the chairman and head of the Cogeco management, Louis Audet, to see.
Coececo Câble will follow suit to his competitors, such as Bell, even if the subsidiary of Cogeco does not yet have a precise date in relation to this new platform.
'We must adapt and change or resist change and fail ', as Mr Audet pointed out.
The ultimate aim remains to offer tools to which our customers do not currently have access.
The telecommunications giant Rogoers has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says that it is in discussions with some major cables so that its service can be available via its distribution platforms.
The s.-d.g. de Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement by the Harper government during its Top speech on 16 October last.
Ottawa wants to force the providers of cable and satellite television to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the card.
"It is almost two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of chains is not working," said Mr Audet.
However, it hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will result in interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions as a new frame of reference for defining our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," said the s.-g. de Cogeco.
The CCTC has been holding consultations with the public since last week and should continue with industry next spring.
On the results, Cogeco indicated that there was a net benefit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 by action.
This is a retrograde step compared with the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83% in action, in the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline through recoup costs linked to new acquisitions.
In 2012, the cable Atlantic Broadband, which was established in the United States, was established in 2012 for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition by the company after the failure in Portugal.
Last December, Indian society also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprise, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
Cogeco's income grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are EUR 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90% by action, falling back on the 45.7 million, or 93% by action, of the same period last year.
The income of Cogeco Cables has, however, risen by 45% to EUR 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers in Cogeco Câble is increasing 5546.
Mr Audet is not concerned that the number of customers will fluctuate in this way.
For me, it is not an indication of a change of trend, he has observed.
This varies from one quarter to another with very fierce competition.
Horse in beef products
Meal meat has been found in beef-based canned boxes sold by two small British retail school teachers, and has now announced the Food Hygiene Agency.
Travelling tests have revealed that the products produced in January in Romania and sold by the Homes Bavin and Quality Save chains contain a horse-trading of 1 to 5%.
'Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product ', explained the British agency.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked plants broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's examinations, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles took four wounded, early on Friday, on 131, in Lancet.
Shortly before 4.00, a motorist who moved in the north, in Saint-Felix-de-Valencia, lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that moved in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
The movement had returned to normal to 6h, Friday.
Frontier Airlines is planning to pay hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines envisages paying up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand-luggage and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday it indicated that passengers could take the unopen cane with them at the plane's descent.
The new costs of hand luggage concern the bags in the higher compartment, so small bags installed under the siege will always be free.
Frontier said that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if travellers were paid only once at the boarding door.
Frontier spokesmen, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was intended to induce travellers to pay the costs in advance.
We do not want to pay this price, she has explained.
Airlines have started to pay the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs were doing as much as they could in hand luggage in higher compartments, so there was often no room for such compartments.
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money.
It is a question of making the most trustworthy Frontier customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in higher compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's site will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger queuing up at a border boarding boy could carry a sack free, while the next person in the tail could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the site and the border registration procedures are changing in order to ensure that passengers know that these costs exist before they reach the door.
Frontier baggage costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often travel on charges of luggage and other costs, but airlines are adorning them.
They believe that the costs of handling luggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street regard the addition of luggage costs as a sign that airlines are paying quite a lot to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them have not affected the costs of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had the first costs of hand luggage three years ago, and the low-cost company Alleanza followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, which has declared the consultant to airlines Jy Sorensen, which closely follows the costs.
In a report in December 2011, he estimated that the cost of Spirit's hand luggage was $50 per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwater Airlines framework, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the boarding door at a time when passengers would discover the costs of unfamiliar hand luggage imposed by the company.
I had never seen such a fluid start-up procedure in all my professional career, he said.
I had expected to see teeth and baggage knocking at the door.
The plane was full, he added, the passengers were on board at the speed of the clarity.
Frontier is also like Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier has indicated that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can take the unopen cane with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but returned back seven months later after the passengers complained, while no other large airline had followed.
The Sortier decision to pay out hand luggage costs when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage clients to go to his website.
Airlines pay online travellers like Orbiz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half of all loyalty to customers buying their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the bonus premiums by 25% on a journey.
For example, a Frontier visit to a online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the site of Frontier.
Frontier has a faithful clientelist in his home town, Denver, but his activity is shrinking and losing money.
The revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity fell by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Public Airways Holdings Inc.
Republika Srpska has tried to redress the Santa's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an internal error, not computer hackers, for the breakdown of its site.
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal mistake that has taken place during a planned update, and has indicated the spying agency in a declaration by email.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The allegations that the breakdown was due to a devoid of service dissent (DSD) are false.
Earlier this evening, traces of online servers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier on, a NSA spokesman indicated to ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not at all a compromise.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesman.
At least one group of online hacktivists has claimed to be responsible for the NSA's breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks are aimed at flooding a target site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the system.
The previously ultra-secret NSA, a time named No Such Agency, has found itself in the spotlight and strongly criticised over recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programmes at national and abroad, which are part of the NSA secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former disabated consultant of NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has caused much speculation that this evening's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre Centre Centre CVF closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned it sold it to promoters who are going to turn it into student homes.
Three hundred and fifty people were working in hotel.
Of them, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers have come to meet employees directly on the spot, people have been met individually to assess their needs.
'This support will continue for the next six months, 'explains the regional director of the work relations of the Hôtel Delta, Felix Beilt.
The closure of Delta is in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was the owner of this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate, so there were investments of tens of millions, while competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or either he sold it to someone else, and that is what happened," explains Paul Arsenbault, the holder of the Transat Tourism Chax to the School of UQAM management.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the next few months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 houses will be in two years' time.
For the CEO of Tian, "Goodyear Amiens" purchase is starting with zero. "
After casting a spade in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear's Goodyear's Goodyear site promised closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of American tyre Tian, declared today that he is ready to save 333 jobs on 1137 of the plant.
Arnaud Monteburg, the Minister for productive recovery, had already announced this, on Monday 21 October.
Having renounced the plant's purchase plan in January, you are now returning.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, talking about 'so-called workers', who 'work three hours' a day, 'mad' unions, in pursuit of the CGT.
We do not understand this U-turn.
Is this to be a pleasure for Mr Monteburg?
I am not trying to please anyone.
Excuse me for my wife.
Mr Monteburg is a young man who is trying to save the best-paid industrial jobs.
If I have injured someone by saying something, I am sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Is the truth baffling?
Working seven hours a day when other countries work eight hours handicap France.
In India, China and in other countries, we are working 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I do not have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well situated and has room for expansion.
Why does Tian so badly need this plant?
Tian does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a proper price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now let us imagine that Tian buys the closed factory in Goodyear.
Therefore, Tian could move machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Monteburg knows this.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Tian agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1 200 current employees of Goodyear.
So Mr Monteburg needs a commitment from Tian before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear are hammering out an agreement on departure allowances for all employees.
So there will be no employees in the factory.
Mr Monteburg said that you are prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm this?
The only number I have mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on initial compensation payments.
If all employees accept them, the factory's purchase project starts with zero.
How can we give guarantees of employment time when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr Monteburg succeeds in getting the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Tian buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens for more than four years.
The Bombing of Bombath, while the Designment and Order of aeroplanes
Bomardier Inc, the Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% fall in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a drop in orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trust Division.
Bomardier, based in Montreal, has not provided any flight data for his brand new CSeries plane or information about whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial service before September.
After the inaugural flight of the trial plane about a month and a half ago, it was only stolen three times, and the question then arose as to whether the trial phase was on the right track.
The results did not match up to expectations, and stock prices fell by 8% in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameroon Doerksen, analyst in the National Bank Bank, lowered its rating on Thursday, shifting from overperformance to performance in the sector, owing to the low stock market potential in the next quarter or two quarters.
Although the decline in deliveries of aircraft has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transportation Digital, which Cameron has declared on a note to customers.
We believe that Bomardier will have new orders for his CSeries aircraft as the flight test programme moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombying hopes that the family of CSeries will be able to cater for it in the smaller segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was first taken in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries "aircraft is modest up to 177; it seems that potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's assertions about energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new online airplane.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beautaire, chairman and head of the management, is convinced that Bomardier will reach his target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft start trading.
Leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was advancing in accordance with the timetable.
The trial aircraft did not stay on the ground for longer than expected, said Mr Beautaire at a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software update were planned during the flight time of the plane.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We decided to proceed with a first flight and to provide for a period of updating, and that is what we have done.
This will happen throughout the flight programme.
The second of the five test aircraft should be flying in the next few weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards.
But analysts are skeptical of the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombard indicated that it is assessing the timetable for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
This slowness of the flight tests, although it is apparently consistent with the internal timetable of Bomardier, reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015, Mr Doerksen said.
In the third quarter of November, the net benefit of Bomardier fell to $147 m, or 8 cents per se, compared to $172, or 9 cents per action, one year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The income has fallen slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 million.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per se and income from $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / S / S.
The fourth aeronautical manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter of a year, against 57 a year earlier.
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautical division amounted to USD 32.9 million to 30 September, an unchanged figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing, as Mr Beautaire said.
Aeronautics's income has fallen by 13% to $2.
Bombying, the world's largest railway manufacturer, has said that the income of this division has increased by almost 11% to $2.1.
The Transportation Championship totaled $32.6 to 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transportation Division have suffered from implementing problems concerning a few large contracts.
Leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bomardier's shares, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google's financial management, would sit on the board of directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 dollars in Canada in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aeronautical manufacturer in the world and competing nearest to Bomardier, indicated on Thursday a 10% decline in its quarterly benefit.
Two speeologists from 23 and 27 years of age were missing in a chasm under the Dent of Croats since Thursday evening, and we heard on Friday of the Spéeéo rescue from the Isle.
They were located on this Friday afternoon.
Both men, in practice, and the other not, were left on Thursday to 9.30 in order to pass through the Dent of Cromes, on the municipality of St Pierre-de-Chartrous.
Then there was no news from them since then, which specified the same source.
"Speetheologists should have appeared around 5th of the morning," said Thierry Larrebe, a technical adviser to the rescue organisation.
Dozens of people on the ground
Two dozen rescuers, ten members of the French rescue system, and the police, the CRS, and the firefighters were there.
At the end of this afternoon, the two speeologists were located.
"Another group of speleologists who, after having found them exhausted but healthy in a cavalier, sent information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network" explains Dauphine.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of Chambers' alpine Chambers were found to be "exhausted but not injured."
They lost their lives in the network, returned to their rescue while waiting for help, specified prefecture.
Refuelled, they should emerge from cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists "union invited its adherents to stop using Google and Yahoo online services after further revelations about the activities of US and UK intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends to journalists to avoid a new order to use search engines and Google and Yahoo messengers," says in a communiqué.
It considers the Washington Post information to be 'scandalous', according to which the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government's Headquarters (GCHQ) collect mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronise their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordination of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," adding Michael Konken, the president of the trade union, who claims 38,000 members.
They are painted: a Member asks for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project by Minister Brigitte Grouwaels of 'Listening' of traffic lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project of repainting 16 firetraffic lights from the region to the yellow and blue colours in Brussels.
The aim is both to increase security and 'the identity of Brussels'.
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels signalling lights at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the French minister's blue-collar approach is "too grim," according to the Brussels MEP Emmanuel De Bock, who talks about the "surge" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not happy to spend money wisely on Brussels" money-sharing operations in the colors of the Brussels Région Brigade, Brigitte Grouwels continues to fan the Capitals of Civille, "insurgents Mr De Bock in a communiqué.
After his yellow-mannial taxi taxis, she eventually painted a black blue-light blue-collar in Brussels.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no 'more difference of visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels'.
The Brussels laws deserve better than to see their money squandered by a CD-V minister who itself carries out the NVA programme.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"To recall, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes to 0.5% of Brussels's laws!" concludes Mr De Bock.
Pu-de-Buis's Pass
The ecotax of Pu-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Grants arrived shortly after 10 hours, and circulation on the national side was hijacked.
The decommissioning decision, announced by the Prefecture of the Finisterre on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, a pork manager.
This is the last of the three state-of-the-art ecotax portals operating in the Department of the Finiser, the other two having been disillusioned or sabotaged.
Lessons of an accessory to Google Glass
A online shop, offering a number of detached accessories to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of connected glasses signed Google.
They can acquire an ear, a charger or even an old one.
This shop, which is strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, proposes a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
At the same price, it is also possible to acquire a form of protection manufactured in micro-fibre or an intractable ear.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass fitted with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
For five years now my father has wiped out the world of living.
At the beginning I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to 'attend'.
There is no recipe, a way of working to pass the wall of invisibility and return to its own.
Then there were signs.
The first time was the very strong feeling that he was present on the passenger seat when I was driving.
On another occasion, a sweet awakening at night to look at his show that leaves me no longer, put on the night table.
This is the image of my smiling father who is accompanying me in everyday life.
Our mother left after her exhausting fight against cancer.
That, at least, was what I thought about the day when I found its empty body, crystallised on this hospital bed with cheese flags.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacier farewell centred around the sledgehammer of the handlers who framed his coffers.
I thought it was part of that.
Little by little, by small, divisive, or nocturnal appearances, a slightly timid, slightly erased approach, it quickly came to my mind, evolving as it regained its place in the landscape of my thought that believed in grief.
And then she revealed my own facets that I had not yet seen, obscured by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother, but simply a woman whom I did not really know, a woman who embodied this person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and liberated the person I helped, and here I found her full and full.
This deviation from my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that the loved ones never leave.
I look at my father, 'both in the devil and outside'.
I have always been told.
I never believed it at that time.
I had difficult relations with him until he became old, ill.
I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I had a bad...
He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands by looking at mine, I was lending my body.
But that was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
It left me with my intimacy.
It lasted for a long time and one day left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I am constantly feeling them close to me.
Every single event, every time in my life, makes me feel that they are present, because I always refer to them: what would they have said?
I am constantly dreaming of them, perhaps not all nights, but several times a week.
I often dream of having to share with them before it is too late, but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing that.
I often wake up to anguish when I come and feel deeply at their absence.
Sometimes, there are some dreams which I do not want and which are part of my history and, indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my mastery in which I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up, I walked out of the bed, my father was waiting for me and he smiled and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy with what happened to me.
And, of course, it was a small boy in my venue.
I wanted to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell you that shared memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died as a result of cancer.
A year ago, she was travelling with my family in Cuba.
That is the shock that his disappearance caused among the young bashing that I was at the time.
However, I have done my bit fairly quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially at times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to take important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a mouthpiece in a large school, has not been, with hindsight, anodyne choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values that she has accused me are still present, so I think I can think of how she would like me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and the right spirit of the one that was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a salvatory spirit.
I see his eye on me.
My mother died ten years ago now.
Morte after I spoke to the telephone.
I have gone through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, beaches that are starting on their own, anywhere, wherever, in insolent places, incongruous moments.
Then, time calmed the punch.
Only the lack of a response, this vacuum without response, the need for it, to give me reassurance, to reassure me of its soft power.
However, it is there, silent presence, it is there and I am looking at it.
Every morning, I see his eyes worrying about me, I see the circles that are increasing their eyes, the rivals around the lips of cigarettes, the bars that are the front days of concern.
My mother has taken on my face and I look at every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn a blind eye.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of a cancer of 43 years.
There is a constant feeling of protection, and nothing serious can happen.
It was his promise on his beleaguered beacon, so little was relearned to smile, and his name is no longer taboo, but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to him in the night's sleep when the absence is too bad, it invites me in my dreams when morale is a little.
We feel stretched and protected at difficult times, and the decline in time makes us realise how much it is the conductor of orchestra and we are trying to stay on the path that it has outlined.
If you have loved a very strong one, the absence cannot be allowed to grind to the heart and memories of it.
In a way, loved ones become your domestic energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I was unable to attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a small boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his own, I always wonder whether my actions are in line with his vision.
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I am not going to do so and I still wonder what it will look at.
I do not know whether I have adopted its way of being or whether I am just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an algo, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, it is on a daily basis.
I feel he is here and I am happy about that.
It is almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I had 28 years and 6 years.
The immense punishment that then invaded me was, of course, mitigated, but it is always close to me.
Very often he is' landed 'in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid and so vivid that I am even sadder to see that this was only a dream.
On the other night, he asked me whether I was going well, I said no, he replied 'I descend', but with such a real voice that I woke up to sleep, anguish and lit the lamp of horse by looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel, and I look back to see if he is not here, I know he is and I am speaking to him.
In all parts of the House I feel that I am there and that is a good thing.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and where it lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived only since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I would like to make it clear that I am a person with responsibility, I am standing and I am a great mother, I am a grandmother, I have full friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never speak with him except with my son, and I am never going to go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been the most deadly month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published the official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the US President.
Nourly al-Maliki wants help from the US.
"We are not saying to the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki on Thursday in Washington.
And, because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will also be extended.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism is alive and spreads?
Nourly al-Maliki spoke to the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were branding placards accusing him, among others, of being a murderer and calling on the US to refuse to provide aid.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned.
Bastharat Ditta, 42 years ago, gave information to the Lord of the Crime Neil Scarrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would be revealed to the great day.
He was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence by Liverpool's court.
A great defender of defence, who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation, because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs was revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Bastharat Ditta, 42 years ago, gave sensitive information to the warlord Neil Scarrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was known as the Basque Basques and considered by criminals as an extremely important file, was arrested at home in 2011 as a result of police-to-Scarborough police operations, which he represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officials resumed Sarborough, 32 years ago, by tabling three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while he was wearing a dinner from Barreau with brothers.
Surveys have revealed that Ditta was a regular consumer-friendly user of class A drugs after tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, his portfolio, and his credit cards.
In an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought illicit information on the arrest of two men for Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 m, and more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years ago, provided information to criminals because it feared that its drug addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool Asset Court, Diutta, working in the cabinet of Forbes Solidarity lawyers located in Blackburn, fell into disrepute after being convicted of two charges of impediment to justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer came after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Diutta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and returned to the home of Ditta and put drugs, pure and simple 60%, under the dustbin of a lawyer in a black golf gang.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Diutta, who was at a dinner at the Wood Park football stadium, a club of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer has returned home, discovered drugs and has phoned up nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular consumer of cocaine after tests showed traces of class A drugs in his hair, his portfolio and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but he did not eat cocaine; he said he spoke about the alleged drug trafficking because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a legal privilege.
During his arrest, Diutta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken.
He said in interrogation that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that customers would appeal to him for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called for major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew.
The prosecutor Anne Whyte said: 'If someone should know that the law should not be violated, it is a criminal lawyer.
Mr Diutta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular customers.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficking, but a drug trafficking drug that is drug-addicted to its own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as he has been able to continue his criminal activities.
Mr Diutta did not honour his profession, but he dishonoured it.
He has been too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he has compromised his independence.
Ditta denied any illegal disturbances and said: if I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately.
However, after the hearing, the superlover Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: 'Mr Ditta has been accused of criminal charges himself when he has begun to obtain drugs from criminal organisations.
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the redemptions of the leaders of organised criminal groups who have entrusted him with valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of trust among the public.
Mr Diutta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter behind the varnishes of his profession.
The unit responsible for serious and organised crime in Lancashire has led the investigation into Mr Diutta, who has been convicted of the three charges of cocaine possession and now hindering justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminals.
Let this act as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and you will bring it before the courts.
Scarborough was himself imprisoned for 14 years after he pleaded guilty of complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in traffic have been sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Diutta organised a Question Time / answers session on his own, when he said that his dream of a dream would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in America's death corridor, his latest guest at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be the motivation for him to work.
Aretha Franklin will return to the scene in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the sine will take place on 21 December in the Sound Board of MotorCity Castino.
Mrs Franklin is dealing in November with an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny 'Babyface' Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease that she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on 16 October that the side effects of treatment that she received were "difficult."
She says she is "happy to be back."
Momenting the cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 reasons, 2.2 kilometres of seaweed in the light of light: you could close the hot potato in Menon with the bills of illusory.
This is a measure which, unlike many municipalities, is more and more regulated by taxpayers, not by traders' associations.
In order to ease its costs, the city uses levers.
But also differentiated management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport evacuated after a shooting
There have been shootings at the International Airport of Los Angeles.
It was 10.00 a.m. in the morning when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there would be at least two wounded.
It would be an employee working for the United States Transport Security Administration (TSA) and the fire-fighting author.
The incident would have occurred at terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff have been rushing into the outskirts or on the tardiness.
Very quickly the police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
The classic adolescence of teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five Saynets imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, sticks with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to apprise the classical sword.
In addition to this spectacle, the Kingdom's Marine Society will return with its lyrical SURs, a formula that now fills the Pulpery of Chiapmi.
Two further concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities added the lyrical call, the concert that was held last August, with the help of the sopreano colourcle Marie-Eve Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit-making body to produce a financial balance that is as sweet as the hot air.
Without giving specific figures, the President of the Administrative Board, Yves BerGeron, took advantage of yesterday's press meeting in Chiaptimidi to be reassured.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is getting worse, even in the long term.
We have more solid and consistent support.
'The finances are flattering and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will take in seven years' time, commenting on the administrator.
'I would even go beyond ', added the Director-General, Hélène GaudRenault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy school of Surrey faces six charges, according to the royal Gendarmerie of Canada.
Omar Mustafa Hassan has been accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening threats, wearing weapons in a dangerous, kidnap, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reaction of the policemen involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately have been essential to the security conclusion of this incident," declared Corporal Bert Pquet by means of communiqué.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to stand in court on Friday.
New request for collective redress against the Saint-Cross brothers
A new request for collective redress was lodged against the Saint-Cross brothers, on sexual assaults which took place this time in the Saint Joseph orgy and in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the petitioner, identified as "J. J," who would have been masqueraded in the 1950 "s, first to our Lady-Neil by his professor, the Sousted brother, and then by his professor, Father Bernard, to the Saint Joseph ororatory, where he served as a messiah and where his father worked as painter.
The first appeal was only three institutions, and when we announced the Rules of Procedure, many people said to us: 'I myself was in such a place, or I can register?', tell the lawyer Alain Arsenbault, who defends the victims in both cases.
The collective redress that has just been put forward is peculiar to the addition of complainants from any institution where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the Saint-Cross grouping.
At present, the complaint brings together complaints by 25 people who claim that they have been attacked by the Saint-Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first resort, since several of the institutions targeted closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the settlement of Saint-Cross and the Saint Joseph, which is a separate entity, 'has allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children', 'that they have exercised moral, religious and psychological constraints on the victims', that they 'knew about the sexual abuse carried out and have nevertheless stifled them', and that they 'consciously and consciously chose to ignore the problem'.
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Saint-Cross brothers, Me Emile Perriin, in the 1990 "s, but also by the research carried out in the archives on this subject by Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Saint-Cross who publicly denounced the abuses.
Collective redress must first take the stage of admissibility to the Supreme Court.
Once admissibility has been granted by the Court, the second stage is being taken, or the hearings on the substance.
In the case of the first resort, the consolation of Saint-Cross had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were carried out.
Driving in a Trade
A fire was seriously damaged by the trade in LSalle Arrtonation in Montreal in the night of Thursday on Friday.
The rescue was called to 1h, on Friday, because of a fire that had been declared in the subsoil of an Indian cuisine restaurant on the Dolard avenue, near the intersection with the Rejana street.
The 30 firefighters who were sent on the scene took almost an hour to control the pot.
The fire has "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," signalled the head of the operations of the Fire Security Service in Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in restaurant when the fire brigade came to the scene.
There have been no injuries, but almost 20 houses, located on the first and second shelves of this commercial premises, have had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, because residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily looted, indicated the SIM.
Many opposition to medical assistance to die in the palliative Congress
The Canadian Plenary Plenary, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Liliative Association, Maryse Boutette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, euthanasia's approach would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palace Network also rejects the draft law on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is worried about the consequences for future generations.
'What is the meaning of life ', he regrets?
The majority of palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice-president of the Liliative Library Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, who is also a director of the Mathieu-Francomes-Savoy house in Gatinwater, believes that the service would in any case be useless.
We are never asked: 'I want to die, give me an injection'.
The head of the Ontario Lik Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disentangles people about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that the Ontario will follow suit.
For its part, the Liberal MEP of Gatinwater, Stéphania Valley, says that the concept of end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted.
The Kenyan press is indignant about the controversial media law
It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from putting an end to the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?
This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it, explained Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group, the owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected radio stations and websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court will always be one-sided because it is an extension of the government and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the world economy.
I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this draft law and refer it back to the Members of the House, he has added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have a grip on the media, and the Standard has indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya have suffered a severe blow and that the bill has been dubbed it as a draconian draconian.
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at the commercial centre in Westgate last September.
The Kenyan media have aroused anger by the authorities by disseminating images of video cameras on which the troops deployed on the scene supposedly defaulted the luxury business center.
The head of the police, David Kimaiyo, has responded by calling two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the vocation has been withdrawn following an outcry in the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be able to be punishable by fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being radiated or no longer being able to receive official accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of a offender if it has not paid its fine.
According to the Daily Nation, even one fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations.
It also says that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the Kenyan blogosphere of Kenya.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
No one will ever know, wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Lived to them, politicians would put the country in default and would lead us back to hunting and hunting.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of popular anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cut-backs by the National Commission on wages and restored their robotic wages of around 532 000 shillings per month-exempt tax-free month.
A Hard Year for Pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Laval Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) has caused a great deal of commotion in the direction of the Hospital of City-Health, in 2012-2013.
As a result of multiple retirement ages, maternity leave or departures, the pharmacy department has found itself severely deficient in staff.
It lacked nearly 30% of the staff needed, making this year 'very difficult', according to the department head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to employ an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use of the scanning, Mrs Beaudet explained.
We have rationalised or reduced some of our activities within the framework of the establishment, the time that has been set aside.
It is true that we have worked hard to interest our young people [residents in pharmacies] so that they come and stay here.
There is a conciliatory contest which has led to a bad situation last year.
Improved Situation
After this arduous period, 2013-2014 will be much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
Moreover, the department's efforts to retain fruit have borne fruit, because the four pupils under house arrest in Laval have also decided to remain in the SSS's job.
Now it is much better, highlighting the pharmacist.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three motherhood.
This will therefore close our departures from last year.
Less always Growing
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to foresee.
For us [the number of staff] is still precarious, because there is a young middle class and many young women, with pregnancies, almost always go to three maternity leave when it goes well, has added.
The last year has been much more, and there are no pharmacists who are available to make substitutes, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old toolkit does not begin to work in the cinema by the back door.
The director, Lars von Trrier, has chosen to incarnate Charlotte Gainsburg in Nymphomanac, his next film.
This grandiose pornographic tragedy, eight chapters that will emerge in two parts (on 1 and 8 January 2014), the erotic memories of a quadruple-growing quadruple since its adolescence.
The resemblance of Stay Martin with his elder is striking: a banner of brands, a diapapal tea, and Anglo-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of the risk: the one that had no hesitation in putting on ice sheets is going to be displayed in much more sullipsed situations on a huge screen.
An extract from Nyphomanac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stoy Martin appears in the bed and in full excitement with Shia LaBeouf.
If the film-maker has asked his actors to put their puncers on the placard, he has used X-ray professionals for the most odious sex scenes, before merging all numerical bodies: above the belt, it is star; below, drowning.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trrier used to push their inclinations into their final retrenchment, always for the best.
Mr Martin has not finished talking about it.
A CGM room in Nargood evacuated on Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was suspended at the Mega CGM in Nargood, as a precautionary measure, as a result of the gorge of the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment proceeded to evacuate the Chamber and warned the fire brigade for a suspect smell.
Some 70 people have come out of the sitting.
People have been examined and full recognition of the Chamber has not given us anything.
Is it a joke at the tearmogenic jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
It is still the case that the cinema management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients.
The room has been delayed and everything has returned to order.
The cinema has been able to regain its rights, and customers are returning to the pleasure of images.
Only on the screen.
It is trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into cides.
On the day of the Hallween day, a woman tried to bring into the country two kilograms of cocaine hidden in cides, on Thursday morning, at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was when examining the baggage of the passenger that drugs were detected.
Cocaine had been distributed in three corroborates that had previously been vivid.
Drugs were then transported to the Canadian royal Gendarmerie Office (GRC), which took over in this investigation.
The Canadian border services agency (SAFC) has not revealed where women came from when it was intercepted.
As part of the investigation, Jacquheine Roby, the spokesperson for the SAFC, said that.
What I can tell you is that it came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border service officials at the Montreal-Trudeau airport have made 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, the border service officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of drugs.
Air against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of short-range air-and-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tahal Airport in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor by Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at that time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aimed this time at missiles at sea Yakhu, delivered by Russia in Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation that Washington would reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to respond.
Ukraine's Banking
The rating agency Standard & Poor has lowered the creditworthiness of Ukraine on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's debt-to-government note goes to "B-," which is sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, S & P, seeing at least one chance in three that it will be reduced again in a year's time.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to be secured in order to meet its high external financing needs," explaining the US agency.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign-exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013, and that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits made abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapse, the agency is increasingly likely to devalue, thereby inflating its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle Russia's gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for Ukrainian power at a time of great tension with its Russian neighbour, furious about Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was published in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered from July and September its fifth quarter of contraction.
Its debt, which is still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S & P estimates 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for months for aid from the International Monetary Fund, which granted it USD 15.3 billion in 2010 and has currently released EUR 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, notably by increasing gas prices to the population.
After another unproductive mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the important external financing needs" constituted "vulnerability," while "signalling signs of economic improvement."
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joled, the Centre for Political Studies, 'we cannot expect a short-term improvement'.
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," with presidential elections scheduled for 2015, the expert, questioning the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S & P is also the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditioning on the release of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences linked to Russia's reaction," explained S & P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that, in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
Green greed from the United States to the Public Promise-Omniccom
Puliatis and Omniccom said on Friday that there was no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus moving closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings the second global agency, Omniccom, closer together, and the third, Pulitis.
"Mniccom Group and Puliatis Group have today announced the expiry of the deadline for examining the previously announced merger of Puliatis Group and Omniccom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act of 1976, as amended," announcing both groups in a communiqué.
They also state that they have also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the UNHCR review period in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation to be carried out.
'Merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and on the approval of the shareholders of both groups', adding them.
The Congolese army is persecuting the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would hunt the rebels of the M23 to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
M23 appears to be beaten up after being driven out of the localities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that he controlled since the start of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We are going to continue with M23 and acit it wherever it is hiding because it is criminals," said in Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, the FARC spokesman.
We should not allow them to reorganise themselves because they martyred the people of Congo for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertror Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not change his claims to peace talks in any way.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, took on Wednesday in Kampala between the government in Kinshasa and the M23.
Chews are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill in which the M23 rebellion came into being in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the leader of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the flight from the government garrison and the passivity of Monusco's blue helmets.
Goma's fall led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of manpower, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade made up of South African, Malawi, and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARC's headquarters have been reworked and the army has gone to the offensive against M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"M23 seems to be coming to an end," predicting an expert in Congolese affairs, Jaher Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
That would be historic - it would be the first time that Kinshasa's government has been successful in fighting a major insurgency.
This would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which vehemently denies it, of supporting M23 militarily, consisting of former Congolese military troops.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali raised the possibility of military retaliation following shells falling into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgeois to welcome the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and we seemed unimaginable to be released by the army," testifies to an inhabitant of this neighbouring region of Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (M23), we are traumatised," added that man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have turned out to be negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
It states that 'the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only confirmed cases in France so far'.
Mardi, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already claimed 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second US oil company, reported on Friday that his quarterly benefit was declining due to lower refining margins, while his oil and gas production increased while remaining outside the group's objectives.
Its net benefit in the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per year, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per year.
The analysts surveyed by Reuters were averting on average $2.71 per year profit.
The group has produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, rising compared to the 2.52 million pounds a year ago.
The company is targeting 2.65 million pesky this year, with 25% growth expected by 2017.
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment spending has increased by USD 7 billion in two years and is expected to reach USD 36.7 billion in 2013.
The profits from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This drop in refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus, the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday of a net net benefit, despite rising gas and oil production.
Transport of ecolink: the complaint deemed admissible
The College of Sherbrooke (SCARS) has been demanding, since the start of the school year, $150 per pupil (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for school-leavers in two homes, a service that the organization offers when it can do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
'There is a mediation service which is proposed by the committee and I was interested ', explaining Mrs Leftillo.
According to her, CSRS was invited to mediation and she asked for more time to reflect on this.
'It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions', Mrs Leftillo.
The College of Sherbrooke of the Sherropke (CSRS) Commission did not wish to comment on it.
The organisation has only meant that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbracing on the closure of Hôel Hotel's Hurses
In the face of the frontloading of some of the staff and trade unions, including the CGT, the Health Minister, Marisol Tourten, decided on 10 July to "delay the timetable for implementing the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that cannot be taken on 4 November."
An official request "to run no risk to the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter," but also aimed at not inhibiting the PS campaign to a few months of the municipalities.
Despite ministerial consignments, the closure should nonetheless be effective on that date.
Even if, in the Philosophy, we prefer to use the term 'transformation' or 'change in continuity'.
From November 4, the fire brigade that provided about a quarter of the 40 000 annual commuters of Hôel-God's urgencies will all have been given a sign that they will take over 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of interlocals.
In the Holy Hotel, urgencies in urgencies will leave on Monday to five internal medical practitioners.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
'The Hôtel-God emergency service must close in the shortest time possible, and for us it is 4 November ', unmistakably parks Laoc Capreon, the chairman of the APP's medical committee (EMI), which supports the management project.
'On 4 November there will be no more patients brought by fire-fighters, only people from their own means', confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical chief of the new Hôtel God.
"But we will continue to welcome patients as a matter of urgency," tempting the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the ground to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on the spot, also ensuring.
But it is up to the Risk to decide the closure of the emergency service.
'Things are gradually moving ', Mr Nicolas Péju, the spokesman for the ARS, who, on 4 November,' there will be no change in terms of service '.
"The minister lied us or lied to him," deplores the urgent physician Gérard Kierzek.
Demonstration of his head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for the frontloading of the reorganization project, he defined himself as an "early warning" against a "cynic" decision taken by "the mediocre-administrative technostructure."
"They are stealing and suffocating urgencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he believes.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
However, they are regularly engulfed.
There are, for example, nine hours waiting for Lariboisian emergencies.
In the ARS case, 30 "dispatched" patients on several sites may not represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, the human resources of which have been strengthened.
In both ARS and APP, the "new hospitality model" has been set in motion since 7 October and should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also be involved in establishing a 'permanent care'.
"Where are we going to ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gérld Kierzek for whom "the concept of a serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks "medical regression."
This is going to happen as for the Level 3 maternity motherhood.
People are not mad, they go to where there is best provision of care.
If the Minister does not take a step by Monday, we will change the poet, preempt Christopher Prudman, a doctor and a member of the CGT Sané.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to think about presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, Paris's UMP adviser and elected representative of the 4th rounding régime, clearly stated that "even if the UMP was in favour of maintaining emergencies in the Hôtel God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if responsibility falls."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again reminded France on Monday morning that she had declared herself in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, it would mark its net disagreement, underscore Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the Hôtel-God restructuring has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama Ends the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama gave the National Security Agency (NSA) an end to the headphones that it had on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities, which indicates a US official, Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hand in the case of the NSA's heels after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the supervision of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
On the subject, a US administration official replied: "The US does not conduct electronic surveillance of the World Bank and IMF seats in Washington."
Speaking out of anonymity, this responsibility did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official has indicated that Barack Obama has ordered an end to these practices over the past weeks.
This instruction was given almost at the same time as an end to the heels of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Senate approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes on Thursday, but allowed them to continue.
The committee has introduced further restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information.
The UN welcomes the new objectives for combating poverty.
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the goals of sustainable development that are intended to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began in Rio de Janeiro.
They were in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to move beyond national interests.
I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development objectives (ODD), which has been added.
These DDCs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the MDGs.
The security-related concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful figures.
On the basis of the statue of Sama Machhel, the founder of Mozambique, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to changer peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
We want peace to return; we want stability, we have declared Vanessa de Susa, a general director of an investment company.
Inquizating for the future of his country, he has exchanged his work clothes against a tee-shirt with the name, we want security in Portugal before joining the crowded crowd on the place of the capital's Independence on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clouds since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported initially by Rhodesia governed by whites and then by South Africa's apartheid government in efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not revert to an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and local people.
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy, since the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 million in investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Brazil, Italy, Italy, and Anadarko in the United States.
The Florio, the governing party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo mutually rejects the responsibility for tensions.
The Renami states that the government has initiated the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofa's province, a traditional stronghold of the Reno, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the Renami bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazzana, the Reno's spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government is making the Reno responsible for triggering conflicts, and blames him for attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza said on Wednesday at the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr Dhakama considered himself to be a loser, who wanted to use all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.
Both the Flying and the Reno insist that they both want to avoid war.
But there was growing concern after Mr Mazzana declared that the Renami was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He said in the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Florio.
We want to resume the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness, Mr Mazzana has indicated.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to allay tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are not stopping quarrelling, explained Joseph Hlon, a conscientious and specialist university in Mozambique.
None of them is well prepared to negotiate, and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reform, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The proportion of votes collected by the Renamant has declined since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former Renamo member, should obtain more votes in elections.
Mr Mazzana said that Mr Guebuza, who should withdraw at the end of his second term in office next year, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency, he said Mr Mazzana.
We do not know exactly what the Renamo's capacity is, but it has led to disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most cages have taken place in the province of Sofala, which is located hundreds of kilometres north of Maputo, but where Bira is located, where mining companies, especially Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the Renami threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr Mazzana was falsely timid when he was asked whether the Reno would respond to this threat.
The Reno wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, as Mr Mazza said.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, declares Fernando Lima, director of Medicopop, an independent media company, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
People think that those responsible for the future of the country are the government and the President, and that it is up to them to find solutions to the problems, he has explained.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said that people only wanted stability.
No one cares about Reno or Flying, they just want to return to peace, they want free access to the roads, he has added.
We should teach the myths and legends to children as a way of life-style models, as the author says.
The Thoor de Thor could show that the brutal force of the brutal force does not bear the brunt of the subtle subtle, while the legends of arthurians reveal the importance of having a dream.
The fact that many myths would be far too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases far too obscure to be taught at school, Crosley-Holland advocated careful selection of works adapted to age.
I find it extraordinary that, in America, myths and folklore are already part of the education process, he said.
I have been advocating this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are openly defiance of the fact that children are getting completely out of the way, with messages being blown up in pleasant stories.
Sssley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norths and British Fok Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or terminated, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be supervised; it has been revealed through a history rather than a declared one.
The basis of what is being shown and is not being said.
A fighter from the armed wing of Hamas has been killed this evening and another wounded by an Israeli hair attack in the Gaza Strip, has been learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they had a shells fired at Israeli bars.
Waste of NSA: The US has gone too far, admitting Kerry
The US has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, recognized Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations, and denials between the US and its European allies, this is the first time that a US government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception of communications and data in Europe.
'In some cases, I concede that, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to ensure that this does not happen again in the future ', said John Kerry at a conference in London that he attended from Washington on Thursday 31 October with a video link.
In his speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy has long justified intelligence and information-gathering practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Madrid bombings in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured the US authorities that they had had many terrorist projects since the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have prevented planes from falling, building blocks, and people are murdered, because we were able to be informed upstream of these projects," argued the patron of American diplomacy.
And, as John Kerry said to Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people," they have not been deceived. "
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far," he admitted to the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London, and Rome.
Thursday evening he assured us that President Obama was' resolved to try and clarify and review these practices so that no one feels wrong '.
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the programme known as "UNASLAR" and led by the UK NSA's UK counterpart, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibres used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million elements were collected in January alone - ranging from metal to e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
Such interceptions would take place outside the US.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy have revealed that the NSA would have intercepted massive data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states, and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such heaters, Barack Obama refused to speak on the subject, invoking national security.
By contrast, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied his intelligence agency tens of millions of European citizens "communications.
He even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services that would have seized these communications before providing them with the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the US, and that would not be of any interest to Europe, as General Alexander said.
And the polemic extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia summoned Australia's ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also aroused China.
Paris Saint-Germane will receive Lorra Friday without his master's boy, the Swede Zlaan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, is announcing the League of Lega 1 in a communiqué.
The PSG, the leader of the championship in Monaco, unlike its aims, has broadcast the list of players held for this 12th day match, without the 32-year attacker.
The communiqué simply says that it is' wounded ', without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he was suffering from an inflammation of the left of the left when he returned to the European Parliament at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the Deliberated Death
The Father Lesser's crematorium organises a secular ceremony at 11 a.m., in memory of all the decimates created in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist candidate in Paris City, has to attend, and then, at a press conference, he will explain his proposals for funeral.
To follow the ceremony, cliché above.
For their own obsessions, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September to 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the sake of the nearby, the opposite is the case: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose the creation.
In his book The Death in ash, Damien Guay, the philosopher and Vice-Chairman of the National Committee on Ethics of the Truth, insists on the "violence" of cremation, for survivors.
There is, with the creed, 'violence against the loved body', which is going to be 'reduced to a lot of ash' in a very short time, and not after a process of decay, which 'would accompany the phases of the mourning'.
There is also 'symbolic violence', which is based on the 'elimination of the singular' and 'distinctive signs' of the ash.
Why is it that what is readily accepted in some Nordic countries and Protestants is still poorly lived in France?
'Because the cremation is a new fact ', Marie-Frédérique Bacé, President of the Tanatology Society and author of the book Claiming death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprise it.
To call for the creation is for François Michot-Néard, Director General of the funeral Services of the Ville of Paris, to provide for the demise of a ceremony as worthy as the one he would be entitled to with an inhumation.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, to be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of the people who have chosen a creed want to organise a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want that.
The crematoria have adapted to this development in society.
"For ten years, they have been trying to prevent the families of a wait-and-see attitude, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ash of ash," observes Mr Michot-Néard.
Seventy per cent of institutions now offer ceremonial masters, who, in the presence of the body, carry out the following ritual: welcoming the Assembly, naming the device, linking it to others, mentioning it, giving meaning to its death, organising goodbye.
This has been the case in the Father Lashir's crematorium since 1998.
The masters of ceremony are often people who have retrained.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is within this framework that the Father Lesser's crematorium has been organising, since 2010, the day of Tousaint, several ceremonial, secular and non-religious ceremonial ceremonies, to which he calls on the families of the people who have been set up in the year.
For the second year running, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted, to those who could not travel.
The crematorium has allowed us to pass it on.
In Seychn, Relating to Rates
Earlier this week, a family left its apartment on the floor of the D2 building, owing to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the head of the South Habitat office has proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and its three children in a nine-year old.
However, the family is refusing 'for financial reasons' and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on excessive proportions, as Joseph Canapa, the director of the office, believes.
Rates, there have always been a number of them in cities.
The company of denationalisation makes two passages a year, and, in addition, we are intervening, at our expense, at every request from the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been made.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats do not spill over into the city.
For reasons of protecting the environment and public health, denomination products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats we will not kill a god.
"We have not invited the rats at home," defend the family father who has left his house to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without a soothing and we expect a new housing, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is falling by 0.88%, Aids
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
Costs have suffered from the dollar's decline against the yen, which is detrimental to exporting values and warning about its annual result, launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and Topix gave 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony has fallen from more than 11% to ¥1 668.
A house plagued by fire in the Vicebec
A fire which started on Friday in the Vivé Quebec was quickly mastered.
Over 30 firefighters were sent to 9 of the street Hebrert.
The flame retardants declared in a house of three houses divided over four shelves behind the Seminar of Quebec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was mastered one hour after the fire-fighters arrived, many of whom intervened.
Now that our first firefighters have arrived, they have really seen smoke-filled smoke.
"So the alarms have succeeded, because it was stepping up to attack the building, because it is buildings that are stuck here," explained France Lorst, the spokesperson for Quebec firemen.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
The New New York Compact (New Yorker): The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the place where the stand in America originated: almost 100 years ago, the vultures player Frank Fay, who had the role of ceremonial chief in the Palace Theater, on Broadwalay, began to tell the public directly about the tone of the conversation.
Fay innovation has continued over the years, until recently the New York Compensation Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Caroline Step Club, the festival famous his tenth birthday this year, with over 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and big theatres.
Most of the posters have emerged in Carolines, and they have had a great success, until they become too famous for playing in a club, said Hirsch.
We have created this festival with the aim of continuing to work with them.
The event this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of Stand Up for Heroes, a silver and music evening for the former combatants, organised in Madison Square Garden, to which, among other things, Bruce Stringsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedie.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example by showing spectacles on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has appeared in front of the scene in a cocom on a cable chain (The Hague Times on the theme of the FX Football Football), and now has its own skyrocket spectacle on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate took part in the emitting of Saturday Night Live and was part of the scaling of the series of Parks and Recreation, but it is more known for his series of viral videos, Marcel the Shell of Shoes.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians in the singular voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironical advocate of racial justice, W. Kamin Bell), are purity products from the decentralized world of the US comedian.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a sledgehammer, but he became a film and television film director, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he led a TV program that was called "Sit Down Comedy," David Steinberg.
The meeting is taking place at the Hôtel de Ville in the centre of Manhattan.
The city is definitively in the comic DNA of all of Larry's work, and has declared Steinberg.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he had a ruil between two buildings and said, if I lose all my money, perhaps I will live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese coal-growing manufacturing sector is growing.
The price of America's Gross National Indication Gross Goal in December fell from $14 to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during the electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a drop of 5.8% in October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has plagued prices over the last few weeks.
The US Department of Energy indicated Wednesday that US supplies had risen by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have risen by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector that have arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to shrink after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference for international GDP already used by American refineries, has lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Reference to the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal restored to Texas certain restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in this state, and which largely calls into question the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal's ruling means that doctors who practice IVG will have to have "admission privilege" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admitting is the right of a doctor, according to his status as a hospital doctor, to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre to provide diagnosis or treatment.
IVG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of state clinics, because these clinics failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be about 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments.
On Monday a judge of first instance estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were anti-constitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who bore the post of governor, asked the Court of Appeal to repeal the first court judgment that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary session on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in forging a return, with 1.3 million viewers behind their televisions, 5.6% of audience.
But was the spectacle meeting?
Some 10 000 candidates have presented themselves to the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the Sinclear Part, the perche André Manoukian and Olivier Netherlands.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
Much of the excitement to return to their favourite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium.
As every year, the first round of hearings breeds a broad choice of grass-roots songers, for the best and sometimes for the worse.
Twitter, however, wants spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some of them have found their account.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocation of successful singer is still there, season after season.
Others have just the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and control policy
A Federal Court of Appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the control and control program of the New York police department and despatching the file.
The US Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Schindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has called for its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department to change its policy and the training programme associated with it.
On Tuesday the Court of Appeal heard arguments on the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal declared that the judge should be drawn into the file because it violated the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly due to a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to criticism from the Court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and of Hispanic as part of their control and searches.
She has appointed an external supervisor to oversee changes, including reform of policies, training and supervision, and she has ordered a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in areas where the greatest number of controls take place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal should take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of control and searches has been criticised by many defenders of civil rights.
This control and control system has been in existence for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has risen dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that mainly concern black men and Hispanic.
Judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Those who advocate changes in the NYPD control and control programme say that they will put an end to unfair practices, that they will be able to have more effective police forces and confidence, and that they will be able to change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police officers have been severely reduced over the last decade.
The judge has pointed out that it does not put an end to the practices of control and searches, which are constitutional, but reform the way in which the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must vote, because each of them pays on average $100 per month on the price of housing that goes to the Ville.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between housing.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay new taxes.
By voting, we are sending out a clear message.
We need to change things in the Ville.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay fireworks to $100,000, from $4 to $5 million in case...
To vote, this is the best way to speak and to say that it is enough.
End of service for the Elysée Elysée
Entered in the 500 m2 of Elysean kisdoms, as committed after working in embassies, the cook has engulfed all levels to become a leader nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande via Nicolas Sarkozy, including their holiday places, and fed countless large parts of the world in near-anonymity that he only now has at retirement age to 60 years.
The man with an open face, the unbearable clouds and glasses of intellectual, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is a Cinderella CP.
His mother was herself cooking in a castle of Soviets.
"I have moved from one castle to the other!" ironise Bernard Vaurition, who knows not only the six presidents for whom he has been an officer, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight into catering," to the point that she banned women in the Elysée kitchen!
In contrast to the heads of state who displayed relative indifference to land-fed food, "they are all gurgeons," Bernard Vaurition gently denounces.
Jacques Chirac had a rather more developed appetite.
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed cheese, the beans were empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored cheese, "it is someone who likes to eat," and "there is little that he does not like."
The current head of state, who regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has no request for a specific regime.
Bernard Vaurition also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners at Elysée: "between 200 and 250 people in one hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand if there were mistakes.
The former head of the Elysée kitchen, who took a glass on Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, starts with a pink in the heart. "François Hollande welcomed me."
He has said praise.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The head will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years, who for his part has been in Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in the Vivé Quebec Friday lunchtime.
The four-house building, located on the 15 of the street Hebrert, was subject to three alarms from the fire service.
The fire was declared before, but rose on the three stars of the building.
France Vojvodina, the spokesperson for the Quebec Protection Service, has specified that rapid fire fire intervention has prevented the spread of flame retardants to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector in the city where buildings are built in a similar way.
The burnt house was home to four houses, but no tenants were on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage has been limited, even though water has caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out into the origin, but the undermining of a criminal act has been ruled out.
The Wars of Wall Street: exit from the Second Way
Martin Schorese leaves a few images of his next film, the role of which is the ambitious New York broker, in Leonardo DiCapio.
Forget it to be reasonable and get out of your notes.
Leonardo DiCapprio is going to find out in his role as a lunch.
Martin Schorese tells us the true story of a "Long Island stock-market broker," who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a vast corruption affair on Wall Street. "
In the 1980 "s, Jordanian Bordan mounted an arrows that would make him a rich, rich man.
It is an opportunity to follow its incredible rise, but also the dramatic fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man enrolls festivals, women and drugs.
Debates and excesses of all kinds are the watchwords of this crazy history.
The Scordese-DiCapo couple seems to have found the magic wand that united them in Shutter Island.
The departure from the new Shorschese was delayed due to its excessively long-running monetarist.
It would appear that the film has finally lasted 245.
In the room on 25 December, it will be able to play a fair part in the race for oscars.
Coule used telephone hacking to check a tuyau
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Couleson would have used the telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation to try to confirm a biddle tug on a link involving the then Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Practiur Andrew Estate QC told the World Bailey Tribunal that Newws of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Powlby, his beautiful special adviser.
It was reported to the court that Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, hacking Powlby's voice box and constantly planting his door in front of his door, but Coulson also called it and gave him voice messages.
The accusation suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the chief editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in the house of people in hoping to overtake them; it is the kind of man to love people to bring history to people to see what they say, Mr Edit said.
He said that NotW used three means to investigate subjects: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, of the supervision, and it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Is it aware of the telephone hacking?
It says the opposite, but we say, of course, that if we do.
The rumours on a link involving Clarke were taken first by the NotW office when a source, having sexual attractiveness to Miss Powlby, said that it was said to be saying: 'We must not lose your time with her, she is with Charles.'
A band, on which stolen voice messages on the telephone at least three times were registered, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the Private Deutsche computer that related to Miss Powlby and his sister in a case of Protestant Project.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Miss Powlby's grandparents received anonymous calls for information on her, adding Mr Edit.
In the meantime, the former head of the Netown Thurlbeck and the former postponement James Weatherop oversaw the monitoring of Miss Powlby's least facts and gestures.
In a vocal message he gave him on 18 June 2005, Couleson said: 'I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow, of which I would really like to speak in Charles.
Mr Edit said that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had to confront Mr Blunkett with a married wife when he himself attended the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coule and Brooks denied that they had conspired with others to hacker telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherop have admitted that they have made telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives the Iraqi Prime Minister, who is in the midst of a surge of violence.
The US President had to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday 1 November 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq experienced the most deadly month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1 600 people were injured.
The UN provides even higher figures with 979 dead and 1 902 injured.
This violence is increasingly murderous, despite reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1 073 people had been killed.
Two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence fears a new conflagration, while neighboring Syria is facing a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are shot on the street or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who claims to be politically marginalized and to be the target of unjust arrests, has encouraged this surge of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (IIL), a group affiliated to Al Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in Syria's civil war.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against Al Qaeda.
The violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the US President, elected on the promise of ending the military engagement in that country, painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since its arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and the elected representatives of Congress.
On Thursday, he argued for the international community to conduct a "Third World War" against Al Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance for Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democrat senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, giving him partial responsibility for resuming violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy."
They also demanded Barack Obama to make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing is accusing an Uighur group of the Tiananmen attack
The Chinese head of internal security accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang to be behind the bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, has sunk into the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, killing its three passengers and two passers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the political bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese Government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that are taking place there with pro-independence claims.
'The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organised and premeditated ', said Meng to the Hongu-konix TV station.
"The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, as he said, by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests it was Uyghur, and said that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers full of petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injured.
The Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan is regarded as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a wide-ranging survey around the world of how the parks handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce, and sex-trained couples.
The poll asks participants how priests look after gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women living together without being united by marriage ties.
The poll was sent in mid-October at each national conference of bishops, with the sign of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve an important rally on the family that Pope Francis is planning to organise next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the 'National Catholic Reporting', an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic bishops in the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that every bishop would decide the appropriate way to snub the parochial.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the Internet poll by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The army attacks the last rebel fiefdom
The unwieldy M23, or a few hundred fighters, were cut back to nearly 2000 metres of altitude on the farm hills of Chancellor Runyyi and Mbubzi, near Bunagana and Joma, two localities located around 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province.
'This has not stopped this morning, the fighting continues in spite of the night ', in the AFP an inhabitant of Joma, joined by the telephone at 12.30 p.m., and according to which a girl was shot dead in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has fallen somewhat," he added, "it seems that the FARC Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little."
According to the witnesses wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent night" in Joma before moving on to a "rationing operation."
There was a lot of evidence behind him of crumbs fed on light weapons.
Bunagana, the political fiefdom and the last strong place of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DRC, the fighting went 'in a final phase', with the FARC having 'encircle the positions of the 23 residual people to degenerate'.
Since the resumption, on Friday, of clashes between the Movement of 23 Mars (M23) and the army, Monusco is not directly involved in fighting, but it provides the government troops with decisive support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of this afternoon, several dozen soldiers, many of them supplied ammunition, were in the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier on, on the road to Bunagana, the border post with Uganda, civilian-aided military commanding bombed a multiple-blown rocket launcher on a nine-dotted FARC truck, having to watch another menace plundering the positions of M23 on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels once again on Wednesday evening to "demobilize willingly" under the pain of being disarmed "by force," but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without a result.
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is only Ugandan mediation to organise the signature," said Roger Lumbaa, Vice-Chairman of the delegation of 23, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mostly tumors, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas in the DRC, and its subsoil is full of veiled mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5000 people were refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC that was set up in the morning was reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to replicate," said to the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by its nine children, including a baby on its doorstep.
There is the impression that fire breaks are coming closer to the people.
At the beginning of the evening dozens of inhabitants crossed the border, some with a sledgehammer, to spend the night in Uganda.
The Mosical Generation, the Storm
Classical, sophisticated, popular, English or French productions are taking their plunge.
After Broadwali and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the music to France is a kind of success story.
In the long run, from our Lady from Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts would be made in ridicule.
And the successes such as Cabevet or the Mishers were the mystery of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Chastelet and Tasteliness in Mogadishu has changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes are littering headlines as successful tubes.
The first is, this Christmas, his excellent Mary Fair Lady and announcing the following: "An American in Paris."
In Mogador, "Best and Bear" could be one of the success stories of the season.
On the other scenes, musical spectacles like "1789," "the amateurs of the Bastille," and the small musical comeditions such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are the apathy of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the "history of musical comeditions" book and conferring on Chastelet's theatre, analyzes the reasons for such a hard-won success.
How do the French musical comeditions evolve?
The supply has multiplied.
Firstly, there are the 'musical spectacles' which are changing according to the producers...
Some use fine projections of images and real history as in 1789, the Basttille's Asians.
Others make a 15-year-old leap back on the pretext that you can serve almost everything when you have Matt Potora in front of the poster.
Then there are musical comeditions with the sompous productions of Chastelet that bring us back to the gold age of Broadwali and to discover the universe of Stephen Sonhaim, the largest composer of life.
Enterinthine is popularizing Anglo-Saxon musical comeditions of variety by adapting them in French.
French producers of independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Re," "The Bailer of the Armed Women," or "the spring of spring," have difficulty financing.
Do we have enough artists like Broadwali songs, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical spectacles in a season, it is a great year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn project projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, peat, Broadwali, off-Broadway...
The vivid of talent is as important as the number of posts to be filled.
Why are the pros in the province so successful?
Apart from the opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few theatre parts go round, and it is often a theatre of upheaval for adults and not young adults.
Musical spectacles fill this gap.
It is these same young people who love television and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Protecting beautiful young men (often talented) at the top of a musical spectacle is ensuring that these young girls and often their entire family are engulfed.
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are very well held by professionals who answer questions.
These spectacles are very expected when they arrive in Zumith province.
The Myonnaise has grown in Paris and disguised as provincial.
Shop is designed to enter all the big French rooms in the same way as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning to 5.30 p.m., on the inner flow of Brussels to the likes of Hoilacart, to Waterloo.
The car of a driving force has been lost by a ghost driver who is unscathed.
Ring was closed down to 900, in the place of the accident, the time for the road to be cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
This situation did not, however, lead to traffic jams, because the accident took place in the wake of the Hooligatart exit.
It was therefore possible to deviate from the exit / entry / exit route.
A Children seriously injured in Sisneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident in Disneyland Paris.
Its vital prognosis is no longer committed, but it is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a ship of attraction 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.
It has been closed down to a new order.
DRC: The army is preparing another assault
Children play a carbon carnage that belonged to the rebels of the M23, in Kiumba, on 31 October 2013, in the east of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on the last stronghold of the rebels in the M23, near Bunagana, in the east of the DRC.
The aim is to remove the M23 of the hills that overshadow Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill in Buginia, which overshadows that of Mbubzi.
Today, Mbubzi should fall by itself.
There will only be the Runyyi hill.
"The Chancellor of the Exchequer is not very strategic," he said, the AFP governs the governor of North Kivu, Julilinu Pluku.
Mr Pluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
As a political leader and a strong place of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, several hundred unwielbles of M23 have been cut back to nearly 2,000 meters of altitude on the farm hills of Chancellor Runyyi and Mbubzi, near Bunagana and the neighbor of Joma.
In Joma, an inhabitant who had reported all close fights on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was "quiet since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fights of the day and were buried.
A girl was injured by the ball, and three other people were injured, including an uprising, evacuated by the FARC, added to this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two warring parties have failed to balance the loss of human life.
The NSA's revelations increase the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance.
By a fine day at the end of August, a German police helicopter overran the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BVV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photographate the roof of the American outpost, located below 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BVV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennatics and that the operation provoked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
In September, James Claus, the US intelligence director, once again stressed that the US does not use foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies "industrial secrets for US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But, since Edward Snowden, the consultant who has become whistleblowers, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible wealth of information about the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and corporate leaders no longer know whether to believe the director of the word.
Reports, according to which the US National Security Agency spurned Brazil's oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in Cloud, notably Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused corporate paranoia with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop in the ocean.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate managers are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used in their mutual interest.
Germany needs to wake up, says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the US represents such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY cabinet.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has sent industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
One Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only turn a blind eye and re-open them slowly...
This is not the right way to go about things, it indicates Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong IT industry in Europe, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
But the extent and sophistication of US espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations were a shock for some companies that believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, since European officials have realised that data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation carried out by the Crown Security Alliance, a professional body, some 10% of non-US members, gave up their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cloud after revelations about the US program for exploration of Prism data.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers are asking us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in that court?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There have always been.
This has been a recurring theme for many years, and nothing has changed fundamentally in the current discussion, declaiming Kurt Bock, Director-General of the BASF chemicals company.
The Americans are spying on us from a commercial and industrial point of view just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the preventive measures that they have put in place, if it leaves an opponent the advantage.
Large companies have long argued that it is at least reckless to recover a free USB key in a professional room or to leave a laptop computer without oversight in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Auto car manufacturer, says that the collection of mobile phones before Council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones paid during their travels abroad, owing to the risk of infringing Martphonies "integrity.
The pre-paid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorised access, warning the BfV in a report.
The United States alerts their own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty of the second degree of economic intelligence piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of a renowned German company believed that, when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst ones.
Bernard S4cini, the former French Home Secretary, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying their allies.
The parents of a teenager of Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered.
The parents of a teenager of Georgia, whose body was found in a shambles in the mouthpiece of his schoolyard, believe that their son was murdered, declared the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, Valdsta in Georgia, was found on 11 January stuck in a carpet backed by the gymnasia of his lyrical.
The Sheriff of Lowndes's Comity has concluded that Johnson died in unusual circumstances, but the family of 17-year-old boy contests these conclusions.
They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered, declared Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacheyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought it was dead as indicated in the sheriff conclusions.
They believe that this defies any logic, the laws of physics, and the common sense, added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered with the sole aim of covering the people responsible for the death of their son.
They sent their son to school with a cartable and they had been sent to a dead bag, he added.
The US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore declared on Thursday that he was carrying out an official investigation of Johnson's death, pointing out that a number of important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow up the facts wherever they lead.
My aim is to discover the truth.
I consider that there is a sufficient basis to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was killed by a posite asphyxiation.
However, a second auopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
There are a number of questions that still need to be answered or confirmed.
Moore added that if he updates elements that justify a civil or criminal investigation on Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff office of Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to submit all video recordings that investigators had examined.
The parents of teenagers have said that they hope that video images contain indications of the circumstances of their death.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in children to schools
On Wednesday, the United States Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published a series of directives indicating how to deal with the food allergies of children at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the US Government publishes, since the number of school-age children with food allergies has soared.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from food allergies.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of the desecessal body and staff with food allergies in the child and how to deal with them in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends to schools to have a stock of epipheman, the EpicPen-brand self-injector is the most commonly used in order to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially lethal anaxisia.
The legislative assemblies of the Member States have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have more fluephoots in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms issued by children who have an allergic reaction.
The children can say, and I have the impression that something is being poured into the language, I have the impression that I have a hair on the language of the language or the language I have on the language.
The NSA case highlights the complete lack of intelligence debate.
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government, which is being played out in public by convening the United States ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand forbids the overflying of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on board Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande phone to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius conforms the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in Monde's columns a few weeks from now, on the one hand, the reproduction of US diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the heels of the Quai de Orsay by the NSA?
Would it not be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not moral positioning, but research into the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil over US diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, this is not in any way an indication of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information from the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The fact that the United States, but also France, has been in place for nearly ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, have established procedures for the cooperation and exchange of almost daily information and are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to pass whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to US services, and, in return - as has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French on other parts of the world.
So the basic question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to have interception tools, but the question of the complete absence of prior debate, especially in the parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the issue of infringements of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States?
We may denounce them, but I do not see how they can be punished.
America's risk may be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top summit of their governments, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the US have strained.
Another effect can be more economic: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US law, and thus to the capture of NSA.
My final point is that the vast movement of revelations committed by media throughout the world, which helps spark a debate on intelligence-led intelligence intelligence practices, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they gave to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexual children can choose unspecified sex.
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of the new born will no longer be given a rigid birth at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their children, allowing them to include an unspecified, non-specified sex or non-specified sex on its birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could make hasty decisions about a surgery of sexual reassignment for their infants, and to combat discrimination against sexually-motivated people.
According to the BBC, an intersexualized person would have said years later, and I am neither a man nor a woman.
I will remain the patchwork that has been created by doctors, conglomerates and bullets.
It is estimated that a child of 2 000 born every year is neither a boy nor a daughter.
They are intersexualized, intersexuality, part of the sixty-year group of diseases diagnosed as disorder of sexual development, a generic term naming people with unatypical chromosomes or gamblers (eggs or staples), or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexualized.
Sexual identification is still not fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to allocate it, then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist on sexual identification issues, said that the new German law seems to be a good idea.
Inter-sex children pose an ethical dilemma.
Some people are suffering from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act, but that is not the case for most children, he added.
It is possible to make sexual assignment without operation, and to see how identity develops.
The science of how a child develops sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It is like the mystery surrounding homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described sexually-motivated persons as different from transsexuals or transgender, since their status is not linked to gender, but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively a man's or exclusively one of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters, such as muscle mass, pilotage, pests, and traineeships (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or chromosomes and hormones structure.
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexually and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-compliant kind now have camps that are specifically intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female, or third-sex sex in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognised as neutral, having won his appeal trial, which allows him to retain a non-specified sex.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F X for intersexuities, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this landlocked country signed a petition so that gender-based gender theory would be removed from school books.
The American Catholc Online site also opposed German law, writing that, as the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, it turns two other pillars of civilisation into reverse.
In Maryland, the mother of a infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child, she has declared on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphrots, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god that had a dual sex.
And, just about ten years ago, the medical community regarded gender as an arousal, one that can be wiped out and can be redrawn.
But there are now many who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can mislead, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reasnaissance when he grows.
In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency, and said Drescher.
When these children were born, they were not called psychiatrists, they were telephoned.
The prevailing theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr John Money, the Johns-Hopkins University, who considered gender to be evil.
He devoted the term 'sexual identity' to the term 'sexual identity' and argued that social and environmental signals to the way in which parents raise a child interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as John / Joan, his theories gave rise to controversy.
He advised the parents of a small boy whose penny had been cut off in a botched circumcision to keep him fully behind, kidnapping him as well, and raising him as a daughter.
Money presented this as a successful transition, but it was not the case, declared Drescher.
At the age of 15, he became a boy and married with a woman.
But 38 years ago, he committed suicide.
Dresden has said that some doctors are always repeating this model.
But in the 1990 "s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say that they are not happy with the outcome.
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer of Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but with ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large cliché or a small penny and was convinced that he could never have a decent life as a man.
So, shortly after its birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical abdication of the external body and the testicular, and was high as a daughter.
Women were taken into account at the age of 12.
I knew that I was not a daughter, he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
For 18 years he has suffered a vagueness.
But depressed and realising that something was wrong, he asked for his medical dossier.
What he discovered was horrified.
I was sterilised at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented its body from producing enough tesstersterone for its sexual organs to develop.
Having learned the truth, he has become a man, following treatment at testosterone and kidnapping the seins.
The surgery has made it sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organisation called Interface Project, which attempts to normalise the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mats, the general director of the non-profit organization based in California's Advocate Advocate-General, fears that German law calls for labelling and stigma.
Many activists worry that German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their children an "undetermined" sex, as has been said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We believe that it would be better to allocate a male or female sex, and to wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only put forward hypotheses.
Tamar-Matra said that his organisation supported Australian law because it allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third sex.
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind of law, and it has added.
The German law concerns the award of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should carry out at that age.
When they grow, they will be able to take decisions on their own bodies.
However, Dr Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specialising in the mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, has said that German law will make parents and children responsible.
Dr Baratz's daughter, Katriz, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called full insensitivity to anodyne.
As a result of the failure of its anodyne receptors, Kaure has developed women's characteristics.
It has a vagaries, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, the age of 29, Kaurry is married and interior psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is sterile, it hopes to have children through adoption services or wearing mothers.
The law leaves a certain amount of latitude to parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions, as Baratz said.
This gives them time to carry out certain tests and to understand them, and a deadline before they include male or female male.
So you can raise your child and love it all well.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what is needed, he said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he feels the most comfortable, and that is something wonderful.
This allows the child to take the decision for itself.
Letta's Long Liability
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta judges that his government will hold until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to defeat Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In a daily interview with the Stampa newspaper, the center-left leader says "firm intent" to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former Council President convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, makes his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped together around the National Secretary of the Freedom Party (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October by his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's injunctions, which already wanted to crack down on the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Agency, TSA, and a suspect have been injured during the exchange of fire.
The fire brigades called on the scene of the tragedy claimed that they responded to a call for "multiple wounded."
"The forces of law and order are on the spot," he says the airport on his Twitter account, while television pictures showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There has been a shooting," said to the AFP a spokesperson for the US transport safety agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a headache, and a second shipment on wheelchairs.
The incident took place at 9.30 a.m. (12.30 in Montreal) at the airport's terminal 3, which also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times says that the towers 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was not able to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights arriving and departing from the airport were suspended.
The Israeli army kills a Hamas member in Gaza.
Israeli tanks killed an Islamist Palestinian militant Hamas on Thursday and injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, as has been learned from sources of health services.
A source of Hamas has explained that fighting broke out in that region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian morals.
The Israeli army has merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area close to a tunnel called "terrorist" by Israel, which was widened at the border and whose discovery was announced in October.
Report: Obama's campaign to leave Biden to Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers considered, in the greatest secrecy, replacing Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event in the very long book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heiann, Dounble Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear, and said on Thursday evening that the president's closest collaborators had carried out thorough work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 to see whether Biden could help Obama with his re-election while his hopes were diminishing.
According to the Times's political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials in the campaign and the White House, namely former Secretary General of the White House, Bill Daley, to see what effect the former Secretary of State of Clinton could have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that was fiercely guarded in the Chicago campaign in Chicago and within the oval office.
Only half a dozen councillors of the president, including Daléry, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former advisors in the White House David Axelrod and David Plaffe, knew that change was underway.
Dounble Down says that Déry has led the charge to replace Biden, despite their close personal ties, before finally deciding on change when the figures showed that Clinton on the presidential list did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success.
In an interview with Martin, Déry confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Clinton with Clinton.
I said that I had looked at a whole series of issues, and that was one of them, said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that, at that time, the President was not in the form, and so we were told, the Lord, what we can do.
While Daley described the peer review as a matter, Martin indicated to Anderson Coper CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to discover whether change would be beneficial in the vote.
The countryside does not devote much money to the polls and to the discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action, having declared Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team looked at substitution.
Martin said on CNN that he asked Daly whether his boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Déry said that he did not believe that the president was aware of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was possible for Obama to know.
Martin has added that Dounble Down did not conclusively answer the question of whether political polls had reached Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought that Obama did not know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was being considered.
Perhaps he has responded, Mr Martin.
Do you want a fluo ice?
A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorinated ice ice in the world.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluororescent properties of this marine animal to develop a lumind collision.
He had the idea after reading a study on the misses and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the body of protein in order to make it brilliant.
Chris explains that, since the ice cream begins to read when she responds to the heat of the mouth, the more lifeless it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the glacial company, Lick Me I'm Delicides, said: 'It is incredible, but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of that cost costs approximately £200.
The protein that we use in the ice is reacting with a neutral H-H language.
So when your mouth is warming up the protein, the level of poison is rising, and the ice is shining.
We have tested it in the last few months, and it seemed appropriate to share it with all of us at the time of the Hallween, because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice I have created, because megabulsion is four times more expensive than gold.
Every single shop costs me about £140.
But it has a good taste!
The experimental company of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfume such as beer, cheese, beef, and gold.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: I really would like to develop an invisible ice.
This is inherently impossible because of the refragmentation caused by the ice crystals which are the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do that.
The ice uses the fluororescent properties of the meadow of Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a taskforce sitting
The Lord Lou Reed singer died when he was carrying out tacit tai exercises, released his wife Laurie Anderson on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper 'East Hampton Star' and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, when he looked the trees and made the famous 21st-century Tati movement, with his musicians flying the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a static leader, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she promised her husband, the week before her death, that she would get her out of the hospital and take her home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the wonderful joy of living he had."
Lou Reed last May had a liver transplant.
Hallen 2013: In figures
When I was a small, Hallween was a magic man.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bonuses, go to bed late and disguise ourselves to go to the neighbourhood.
Today, I have become more ingrained.
In the last two years I have not distributed a single good sweep, and I will certainly not do so this year.
But Stalinists show that I am the black sheep when we talk about Hallween.
The majority of Americans, in fact, will be celebrating Hallween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in sweets, cooks, and decorations, according to the National Return Fund.
What I look forward to every day in Hallween is trends.
Fossies should be $1.2 billion over the $6.9 billion that the NRF has spent.
This year, the excitement of excitement is faltering.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect many zombie, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the Daft Punk space will be among our Instaggram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are zombie, Batman, hackers and witches.
I assume that there is no difficulty in remaining traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animals this year, according to the NRF.
There are many strange dogs hidden in dogmatism.
When it comes to bonuses, it is not silly.
Americans will spend $1.9 million on bonuses this year, according to the Nielsen cabinet.
This represents around 272 million kg of barres Herhey, sugars, Milk Duds, Twizlers and Barres Clark.
It is a super-new for the 41 million children who are heading for bonuses in their neighbourhood, according to the US Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, let us not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Hallween.
Bluefin corn is the only thing we do not want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold to Hallween, according to the National Conflicts Association.
This represents around 9 billion grain grain.
It is a mystery that I have not yet managed to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Hallween than Hanu houses.
They have the best names, such as Terror Behind the Walls (who is actually a real prison), Howl-O-Scresam, and The House of Shack.
In fact, there are 1 200 Hanofficially recognised houses in the United States, which generate about $500 of revenue, according to America's High Representative, and this includes these wonderful pictures of you that you are putting on Facebook, and which you cannot remove and on which you like a kind of nice-headed comment.
Finally, let us talk about clearinghouses.
Charlie Brown presented us with the Grose Ciroilles when you were glued, and sculpated a shell in the form of an lane, it is like decorating a Christmas tree, it is something that we have been doing since we were very small.
Fortunately for us, the trend of the baby-cliché is only beginning last year thanks to Pinteris, so most of us have sculpated these poets and have not had to sit down.
This year, Americans will spend around $106 million in cement, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The clearinghouse shells that drowned on your house's pork probably came from Illinois, where 542 million hectolitres were grown this year.
If you seek to point out more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpate their 922 kg clichés.
Royal Bank of Scotland will, internally, create a charity structure ("bred bank") comprising €38 billion (€45 billion) of the riskiest assets, a measure aimed at relaxing its relations with London and accelerating its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet by 55% to 70% over the next two years, and hopes to clean it up in three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for the depreciation of dubious additional debts of £4-4.5 billion over the quarter, a write-down linked to the formation of the capping structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release $10 to 11 billion of capital, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "Bank of Banks" would draw a line in the past, with the government in particular being accused of meddling in RBS management.
"We can now move forward, concern ourselves with the future and the 90% of the assets that constitute a truly good bank and build a large bank for customers and the United Kingdom," said the new Director General Ross McEwan in the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of ladders
Internally, there are bouquets and seatbelts at 6 points, and an Intercom system.
Among the options, such as improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, the Director-General of Bowler Motorport, has said: the amateurs who join Bowler have changed.
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are truly happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying to try different forms of rainfall in the United Kingdom and internationally, and to prepare for the rivals and realities of raids.
We had a great deal of pleasure in developing the Defder Challenge's vehicle, which is really going to be palpable.
In addition, Defder Challenge will propose a training and testing day in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The fire brigade was called to rescue a lost chiot after staying stuck to 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornik in a career.
Ruby, a cocker-cocker, had escaped after a road accident without gravity.
She was picked up three days later by a person who promised her dog stuck in the career.
The fire brigade took off the cliff to recover the chip and save it from a certain death.
A chiot had the chance to escape the worst after the fire brigade was called to recover safely when he was lost to 15 m above the ground on the volatile season of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month cocker cocker, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years, and his small friend Becky Hall, 20 years ago, visited Flecsy's career in Domenicme, in the West Yorkshire, to return to Rby and thanked the West Yorkshire rescue and rescue service.
They had desperately sought their lost Shia and launched an appeal on social networking sites after they disappeared in the careers of an accident without gravity.
Towards 14,15 on Wednesday, a sharper-minded person who promoted his dog retured Ruby on a cornucleus in a career, stuck to 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team in Ceckheaton's fire-service cracks ran out on the scene, and was descended to save Ruby by using a cage for animals to carry it up to the top of the cliff.
The technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: 'It was in a precarious situation.
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m of the summit and 15 m of the ground.
She did not budge during the rescue process, she was frozen.
But it is going right now.
She has eaten biscuits after.
It was a very unusual appeal.
It is unbelievable that someone has noticed the dog.
The technical relief expert Peter Lu has said: Ruby has had a great chance of escaping unscathed.
It could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was carried out in the veterinary surgeon for control; his general state was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, Halifax in the West Yorkshire, said: I was terrified when I watched the rescue.
First of all, I did not think it was there.
It was surprising to have it again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had evaporated, she would probably have fallen.
The fire brigades have been wrecked.
What they did was really courageous.
They are so grateful, each of them has been absolutely fantastic.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, has added: it was feared that it would fall, but it did not move.
The fire brigades have been superb.
I cannot believe that it was there.
Mitk Jagger says he never dreamed Katy Perry when she had 18 years.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop declared that it was chorist on the Jagger song of Old Habitats Die Hard in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, he came to me when I was 18 years old.
She added, it was a long time ago, and it was very nice.
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70 years, said that he categorically denies making advances in Katry Perry.
The representative has added: perhaps he is confusing him with someone else.
Perry was one of the songs to appear during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing called for a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The backdoor support for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan, which was based in Central and Western Asia," declared the boss of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television station, according to a video online on a website on Thursday evening.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Communist Party of China's Communist Party (CCP), spoke in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official has appointed a special organisation after Monday's attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of a same family in the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, a border of several Central Asian countries, have precipitated their car with gasoline for gasoline against the entry of the banned City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two dead and 40 injured.
The car driver, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declares itself to fight for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, the former name of China's Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 as affiliated Al Qaeda organisations.
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic disorder in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's Disruption gives the Scots the choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European free movement area in order to be able to join the EU.
And there are stories of passport control stories in Berwick and a barbed of barbed wire along the Hadnothing Wall.
While it is true that the newspaper of Strahathyde indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and that was to be predicted).
No one has said that the EU Member States spend a great deal of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued failure to comply with the rules would be a minor concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to obtain from Scots.
So this is a story that is not one.
And a history so old that it has now been fixed: I have heard for the first time the bobbard that independence means passport control, which was more than 40 years ago.
However, an interesting point has been overlooked in this interpretation of an old dust dust.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and arrived on nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and brought the Liberal Democratic Party (the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) to the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket of national economies through joining the single currency, led many people to believe that the Europe Project went too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits, but that was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put its exchange-rate members in favor of German exporters, as German politicians want to retain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in the salaries and public expenditure that Berlin is promoting.
Beyond current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the green energy policies imposed by Brussels, which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is an inhibiting disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage gels in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the grey revolt, particularly in France, is one of the EU's major leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU to be a means of controlling Germany and of putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy damaged.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the Socialists back to power in the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote, a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-European and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-euro sentiment in Europe is going to unite and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will be more like the Europe of the Nations (sovereign) that General de Gaulle enjoys.
Germany and some of its satellites could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will turn a blind eye to the United States.
But America's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all that?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could live with a freer European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a Europe of the non-federal world.
Otherwise we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland's SNP government is a good thing, and it is to be noted that the anti-austerity political movement that has been most successful in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour Lesser, Allistair Darling, and the conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Beginning: Better Old
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of purification earlier than white girls.
Natural Change does not mean that the pubery is imminent.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early pubery.
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys.
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialist journalist in family and health issues in the child.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's seins and robbers are beginning to grow to 7 or 8 years?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kabeowitz, sink-endocrine, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
I spend a lot of time reassuring parents in general, that does not indicate a rapid move towards the full-blown pubery, declared Kabeowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as the capturing of the seins, the poles, and the chips in the purified zone and the bosses, are appearing earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance of the age of first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12-quarters in 1970.
Once the window has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear to be in place, as Kabeowitz, also the author of Early Puberty in Girls, said: The Essential Guide to Coping (The Essential Guide to Coping).
Time is the most precise test of how the pubery is going to develop.
There is a debate about the actual appearance of the pubery, but it is seen as early on when the development of the window is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slowed down or stopped, something that a paediatrician can follow closely.
More rapid development can justify tests carried out by endocrine-based endocrine to avert serious problems such as tumours or kysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent further consequences: premature ageing of the os that can slow down growth and a small size to adult age.
Recommendations for medicinal products and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kabeowitz is cautious with medicines but recognizes that controlling pubery can mitigate some of the behavioural problems and sensation for girls to be different from others.
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their own rules.
They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they manage the hygiene issues, declared Kabeowitz.
It has been a shock, recalls a woman whose daughter had its first rules at 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, it was not prepared emotionally.
It has returned from the frightened and frightened school to be the first among its friends.
There are many theories to public knowledge about the causes of early school.
Yet there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
boys, like girls, reach their puberies earlier.
Kabeowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He took part in a study of girls aged between 6 and 9, which tie the mass mass of fat to the start of the pubery.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In that country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of purification earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
At a global level, early-warning mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, economic conditions for climate, and genes.
Another problem is that, although boys have poles on the face and in the younger purified area, the trend towards a real early pubery is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors attending the APP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acrimonial acupuncture and poles is commonplace, even among infants and small ones.
We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of the pubery, said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a sink endocrine working in hospital for Goryeb children in Morristown, in the New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their paediatricians to know how to talk with their children.
This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected, explained Kabeowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will react in general.
Daughters whose pubery is early must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The Folk-in-the-sand of the Coal brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of Coen brothers, Grand Privals of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the village of 1961 and the crazy music that began to resonate it, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film was the subject of a retrospective retrospective to the French Fifth, had flowed the gold Palem in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Marly, Joel and Ethan Coen cast their hands on the rising star of American film, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the global star pop Justin Timberlake.
In this humble film in which music is a central figure and the songs interpreted in direct terms, Oscar Isaac turned out to be a sizeable musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for mad music with a jubilation contagion.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich aversion of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the wonderful" for less recreational clothes, a soft voice when she sits, but the jury debited by the machine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells a week about the tribes of a crazy singer who is unable to walk and fade with the entire earth.
It accepts the removal of the replaced substitutes in the studios.
Without housing, he is turning the buckets of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tormented, that is what interests us: a mixture of luck, a garlic that is not there at the right time, which is not a career, but incorporates, with self-destructive behavior," reported to the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prices at Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two film fans of mad music built their history on real figures such as the mad musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before Greenwich village's advent, the New York neighborhood called "the epicentre of the surge in mad music, which would create international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then picks up documentary material, dust musical music invaded from 33T invented by an old secretary-long secretary, musical choices of the time, and cafés where songs were produced.
The Cen brothers "magic is still operating by including a funny man who crosses the film permanently: a beautiful cat-jewel watching Llewyn Davis's fortune comrade.
When questioned about how he compiled his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled "greatness in Tennessee, baked by bluds and crown."
"My first lessons of music have been given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the gut," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is needed to "be considered good," "chance can also start the career of someone," and "increasingly today."
Like Llewyn Davis, who rejects any compromise on his music, the pop state explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that may prevent us from speaking."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS," died.
He will never have known the word 'pension'.
From the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday to 83 years, just published his 200th SAS, "The Kremlin Vengance."
In February, the New York Times used it as "the author of spying novels who knew too much."
He was then going to spend ten days in Afghanistan, the scene of 198 and 1994, opponent of the famous series of espionage roofs.
It was a very serious cardiac accident in December 2010, when it was physically reported in December 2010, with a ambulance.
And before Afghanistan, he was also party to Libya, Russia, Lebanon, and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, kept the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul," the first of the series nearly half a century ago.
"Without doubt between 120 and 150 million countries," he argued in March.
His cat Burma on its knees, in the salouson of his immense apartment of a Foch Amending Project at two stages of the Triumph Arc, the malignant eye under his white horses, cited some of the languages in which SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese, or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, he wrote a pound of pounds on the low table between the bronzes or the reported ivory towers of 130 countries.
For the price of a cigarette packet, the reader has the right to traditional coverage with the photograph of a young woman at the advantageous chest, wearing a pistol or a gun gun.
Internally, his seamen allegiance (SAS) Prince Malko Lége, the Austrian aristocratic aristocrat and contractor in the CIA to pay for reparations of the family castle, boils down to the robots of all the land, communists of the 1970 "s, and 1980" s, and then jihadists from the 1990 "s.
In every book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exotism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zesse of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gerard de Villiers.
I regard myself as a contor who writes to distract people from whom I do not send out a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war papers, like Albert London, who went there and came back with real and long inquiries."
SAS's father said "to make a kind of geopolitical fury."
"I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before leaving," adding Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from the AFP, diplomats, people of services whom I know for some 20 or 30 years.
As a result, many of its SASs are often premonitory: a month before the attack on a Syrian regime's command centre that killed several senior officials, he told the story in the "Chemin of Damascus."
In 'Benghazi', he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in that city, the cradle of the Libyan uprising.
In 1980, he saw the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat in "The Cairo plot," a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako," he reported the columns of 4X4 of jihadists who were based on the Malian capital.
I am not a man, defending Gérard de Villiers, I am simply hypotheses from countries that I know well and from time to time some of my assumptions are being realised.
After these trips in often troubled areas, he was installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM in 1976, "whose spare parts have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word 'FIN' and corrected every page in the pen.
The walls of his office are clinging to AK-47 assault guns, the erotic photographs and photographs of the author with African warlords.
Gérard de Villiers, Rélène de Villiers, who was regularly singled out for machism by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organisations, dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always very welcome in Africa, where I have very many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is no age old."
He will not die and will not retire.
Nor do I.
Manufacturers quarrel about the size of seats, while big orders are at stake.
The dispute is raging between the large aviation manufacturers about the width of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for bitter confrontation at Dubai's aeronautical salt that takes place month after month.
The conflict is about the width of seats proposed on long-haul flights to passengers from the economic class, who are not always the most crowded by airlines, but where the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest appliances presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard of at least 18 lens (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing says that it should be the airlines that decide.
The dispute broke out when the aviders sought to sell even larger versions of their flame retardants, hoping perhaps a record of orders at the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats are disposed of at the back of the aircraft, in particular, will have 9 or 10 front seats, which is essential for the economic performance of the mini-juridico-jumbo segment.
Boeing declares that its 777X repaired land will be able to accommodate 406 people in the seats of more than 17 hens in economic class, and will be configured with 10 seats per square.
Airbus states that the competitor's competitor to 350 will transport 350 people in 18-year-old seats on top of 9.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is directly appealing to the public before Dubai's aeronautical salt, where 777X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently been able to see what could be the start of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photograph showing three people from one another in the restaurant, which is what you would accept.
Boeing is proposing long-term flights in smaller seats than in the regional turbine aircraft, which has been mentioned by John Leahy, the commercial director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people are growing, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 "s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-term travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the American average from 40 to 49 years grew by 10%, according to the US Department of Health data.
The size of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 hens, according to US health statistics.
Airbus declares that its rival is cling to a concept of siege that dates back to the 1950 "s, when the flame retardant of the newly named jet was narrower.
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that a further boost to the size of the seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53%.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures with regard to the size of seats and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
It also says that the study shows that the experience in cabin is not only dependent on the size of the seats.
It is really a question of providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do to carry out their business activities, declared Kent Craver, in charge of passengers' satisfaction at Boeing.
They do not want to tell them what they will be able to cost.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a flight race for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at the market price in decades to come, enough to tilt US and European exports.
As Reuters pointed out for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest appliances.
Airbus and Boeing are both claiming a per capita return in their latest long-run models of long-haul drivers 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing is partly dependent on the comparison between 777X configurated with 10 seats per square, and a 777-of-origin model that is configured in 9.
The profit in terms of unit costs is low compared to the configuration of 10 seats currently in service.
Boeing does this in order to be able to wipe out more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products, declared Kevin Keniston, the director of Constrong Passer in the European Airbus Airport.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins confident with 10 seats in the 777 existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper tariffs.
An 18-year-old seat would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of 777, which has declared the internal expert in cabin Kirby, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines have to choose.
The vendors of aircraft who make the rounds of the world even take a metre to check the competing configurations.
All manufacturers, while selling up comfortable appliances, also offer aircraft with high-density-strong configurations to low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus provides an A350 configuration with 10 seats per square, but indicates that it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater personalisation of cabins by offering larger and larger seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the other major builder of large modern appliances, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for the seats will be successful, but that he could forget the wave of 777X sales.
Ellison's Wrong Prisoners
A majority of shareholder shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and director General Larry Ellison, in view of his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but has tarnished the image of Larry Ellison, the world's third-largest fortune, just as a result of his ship's victory at the America Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his pay.
The Oracle Pass relinquished a $1.2 million bonus for 2013 that was closed in May because of the group's poor performance, which failed its growth targets, but received about $77 million in stock options.
Its fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Out of the overall financial year 2013, the net benefit of Oracle has risen by 3.5%, while the bonanza stock market of 27.5%, overperforming the S & P-500 index, has taken 24% at the same time.
The New Annicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine addiction.
Other tests are needed before testing on human beings begins, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weiler Cornell College of New York said that the first signs were encouraging.
We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods currently available on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches, as Professor Cornell has said.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular stream of antibodies.
Antibodies trumpet all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During tests, the vaccinated mice to which the nicotine subsequently gave rise has continued to operate normally.
But the mouse who had not been vaccinated in the first place had declared the researchers, who said that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science TransLatin Medicine.
Previous anti-smoking vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so frequently to ensure that antibodies remain high, and that they are too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
They will know that if they start smoking, they will not be happy about it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to lose their bad habit, he has added.
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but have indicated that much more extensive research is needed.
The Pakistani Taliban leader killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsouth, was killed in an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, and was taught to the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsouth's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, army, and activist leaders have said this time that he lost his life in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsouth was killed in a drone attack," said a senior security officer.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling in London, informed the British government that talks had begun with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies that Obeid is influenced by Obeid
South Wales's former Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
South Wales's former minister, Joe Tripodi, denied that he had changed trade policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three assets in the government-controlled zone.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation into whether Mr Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to renew his balls in Circular Quay, where the Obeid owns two restaurants and coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without any invitation to tender.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Oeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary General of Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of talks that began in 2005, the government pressed for a call for tenders.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer times.
In 2009, the balls on Circular-Quay companies, which reported around $2.5 million a year, were renewed without there being any invitation to tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied that he changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid who, as Mr Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government policy on blending.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed the appeals made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Mr Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the port ministry after working under Mr Obeid's orders to the Ministry of Fishing.
The subject discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of trade-related policy, and asked the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wahaly to Mr Tripodi.
No, Mr Tripodi replied.
I do not remember what we discussed, but at least it was not.
Certainly not between me and Mr Oeid.
Israeli warplanes targeting Syria, declaring a responsible person
Israeli war planes reached a target in the Syrian port town of Labekia on Thursday evening, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The person responsible did not specify what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-125 Russian manufacturing missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has led air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a test of authenticity.
The government is currently examining the possibility of establishing a genuine test of authenticity for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa, while considering extending the repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 from being used to fill unskilled posts or as a backdoor way to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working document has been unveiled today, while Labour MP McKew denounced government discourse on foreign workers, saying that he could offend Australia's neighbors.
The discordant statements about "foreigners returning to the end" and "jobs for the Australians first" are an unpleasant return at a time when unions demanded a protected labor market, said to the Australian Ina Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white work needed to be protected, and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region were to see it as an echo of this historic arteries.
The working document mentions the 12 measures previously envisaged by the former Minister for Migration Chris Bowen.
The Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the criterion of authenticity is adopted, a visa seeker could be checked to know whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the candidate is a personal partner or partner of the owner or person involved in the company that sponsors it.
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum seekers on the island of Christops this week.
The nine-year-old son of man was travelling to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin that was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital in Christmas, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
HS2 Ltd's work suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of Phare 1 in 2026.
The Transport Minister, Baroness Kraer, said that the project would bring together the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keiith Brown, has said that he is committed to working with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England, from £32.7 £42.6 to £42.6.
The British Government, which was in talks with Transport Scottland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of journeys for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh from three hours to the most.
Baroness Kraer said: 'Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network which will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together.
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better thanks to HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Allistair Carmichal, has added: today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish Government, Keiith Brown called on Mr Carmichal to support unequivocally the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: the high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall project of high-speed rail networks throughout Britain.
So we are excited about working in partnership with the British Government to look at the options for getting the high-speed rail network up to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their tablets and sprawlers during takeovers and landing despite the US move to relax the regulation of electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their appliances during critical flight phases, provided that they are air-conditioned.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to have access to their electronic books during takeovers and landing.
Australian carriers are looking at the decision obliging US carriers to carry out important work in order to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the immediate future.
The Civil Assurance Authority also stated that it was examining the announcement, but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft by air, but has declared.
The issue is regulated in a regulation which obliges aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained permanently and passengers comply with the safety records provided by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA of its intention to extend the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was open to change, but said that it would follow the regulator.
We would welcome a review of the CASA which would allow the use of electronic devices, because we really believe that this would improve the customer's experience now that we have - from the Wi-Fi entertainment system using the Wi-Fi technology - a spokesman.
Qansas said that it is currently complying with the current rules.
In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change this in the immediate future, as has been said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the ASPA's decision and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleets.
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing textbooks, training equipment, hand-luggage transport programmes and passenger instructions.
As soon as an airline verified the tolerance of its fleet, it could allow passengers to use light electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic books and marshphonies to all the altitudes, declared FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to switch their appliances during the landing.
The group has also recommended that heavier aircraft should be safe under seats or in higher compartments during takeovers and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in violent baggage
The small municipality of Pia had an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a 30-year-old boy, according to the evidence collected...
On the day of Hallween, the evening has been agitated on the side of Pia where a rie involving several people has broken out on the Post side.
Four light wounded at least would be regrettable.
Alternatively, the policemen went there to separate the warring parties and to ensure that the injured were taken care of.
Singapore's Student Democrats benefit from the middle classes forced to tighten their belts.
A lender of the Bendemer commercial center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga put a brake, a joke, and a pair of gold buckets to pay for his girls "schooling.
My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money has gone in, says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although she won $3 000 from Singapore ($2 400) per month as a feminist and her husband is also working, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia, where household debt is increasing, as ValureMax, where it has carried out its transaction, has become the third-largest donor of loans to be introduced to the Singapore stock market this week.
Meeting jewels is not only a quick way of obtaining cash from $1 300 in Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga, but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank lending.
In general, Singapore's pledge lenders raise an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund provider with a branch in the same commercial center.
But donor lenders have the advantage of not asking for creditworthiness or of wage evidence, and can unblock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to lenders at a time when families are feeling the pressure of rising living costs and overindebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by monetary policy that is too lax in advanced economies, low and middle-income families turn to loan lenders to fill the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor has cited increasing household indebtedness, owing mainly to the rise in mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore recorded the highest debt ratio in Asia's highest household / GDP ratio.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while the rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
The bottom line is that, with rising costs, people in the middle or low [wage ladder] seek to supplement their income as they can, declare Song Seng Wone, an economist at ICMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have meant that people have been quick to raise their personal effects to touch the value of their jewels.
In Singapore, roughly 70% of the articles set out in the 200-year-old loan button are gold.
People say, the price of gold is high, let us bring the gold-plate chain to a halt and we will be looking for it next month.
In Thailand, the largest donor of donor loans, Easymoney, has recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the loan-based sector that ValuedMax, the Bendemeer operator and the other 15 shops such as this in Singapore, are planning to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where there are already four shops but also outside Asia, declares Yeh Lee Ching, his Director General.
The company will finance them by using 60% of the $66 million from Singapore that it has raised this week in its introduction to the Singapore stock exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have been critical of the exorbitant interest rates that they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that the deposit offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but that, in addition, it does not directly increase debt.
Customers are mortgaging goods that they already possess, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt, it says.
Implementation is increasingly socially acceptable as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term.
The people who travel to the lenders are not just those who have financial problems.
The well-off people of Singapore also go to the loan shop on ValuedMax to bring about gold gold or Rolex monsters, which can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers in all sections of society.
It may be easy for people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment activities, or small businesses that have cash-flow needs to spend a difficult course, adding Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Waste accused of juvenile pornography in New Scotland
A boss who cares about young people in the Halifax region in New Scotland is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and the Office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the boss was informal, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a communiqué, church officials indicate that Mr Hudgins resigned from his post.
The carrier has been released under conditions.
It must not, in particular, communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
It will appear in provincial court, in Halifax, in December.
He goes to Nazi uniformity in the supermarket, before being driven out of it.
A man who was dressed with a barbed Nazi uniformed barracks of a breward with the gamy cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, with clients complaining to the head of the establishment who called the police, mentioned the shop on Friday.
"We have received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the shop," he explained a spokesperson for the supermarket supermarket chain.
The magazine has called the police back, but "the time it arrives, he has already gone unscathed," he added.
I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed to be shaken.
People were outspoken.
"You don't walk in the streets unless you want to draw attention," a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years, in the newspaper Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of the Hallween party, where it is customary to disguise itself as monster, but it was difficult to know whether it was a canbar.
A man of Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posited pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black sister twice a week in Asda," he said Paul Duutton, explaining "mental problems."
Tasmania's $325 bailout plan for the Tasmanmania health system
The federal government maintains that the $325-M rescue package for the vaguely health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that government government will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister for Health in Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is now taking urgent steps to end a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic illness and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
The government has proposed an emergency rescue package which, in our view, will resolve the unique difficulties facing the state, as Mrs Plibersek has said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 / $31 campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
Two 600 additional operations, particularly in the area of orthopaque surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
There are also funds for clinics without appointments to Hobart and Launccton, better external care, training of medical frameworks, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records in local hospitals.
These investments respond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to cure the health system in Tasmania, which Mrs Plibersek has said.
The Minister said that the Tasmanmania government would be faced with a strict regime of preparation for reporting and reporting.
The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends additional funds.
A committee composed of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the USD 325 m will not count for much unless they are followed up by real reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania.
However, he congratulated the government on responding to the request for urgent assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the public health system from Tasmania from the blacklist, which Mr Wilkie said.
According to state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the opposition spokesperson on health Peter Duutton believes that today's announcement is a recipe for a fortune.
The reason we are here is that the State Labour Government has withdrawn USD 430 million from its health system, said on ABC TV.
You cannot have a government government that commands nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and claim that it is a good day.
Mr Duutton has visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package will be spent on extra bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic leadership and careful recovery of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In France of the 1760 "s, it is telling the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat who is sent to a spouse by his family.
When it realizes itself, it faces the unfettered cruelty of a Manta Superilater, who is deliberately sadistic and is becoming a subject of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pays in glaciousness or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious nature of the narrative could also become a pensioner for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says the supervisory body
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions full of toxic gas, declared the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency on Thursday, when violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also declared on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Chemical Weapons of Chemical Weapons (OIC) arrived on a day-to-day basis on the deadline.
1 November set by the organisation based in The Hague ordered Damascus to destroy or make unusable all the chemical weapons production units and machinery to mix toxic gases and to fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves.
It is estimated that the country has approximately 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sardin.
The announcement was made at a time when the fighting was raging on Thursday in the town of Safira, which, according to experts, is home to a chemical weapons production unit and to storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory.
The group of militants, following developments in the human balance through a network of Syrian-based militants, declared on Thursday that 120 296 people were dead.
Of them, there were 61 civilian 67, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, 29 954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces found dead, including 18 678 fighters of pro-government forces and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah activists.
Among the deaths, it is also estimated that 2 202 were deserters and some 5 375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops are fighting against the rebels, many of whom are linked to Al Qaeda groups, to Safira for weeks.
The Centre said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not give any details.
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that is continuing, within tight deadlines.
A statement by the OIC, which works closely with the UN, indicated that its team was now satisfied with having controlled and destroyed all the critical production and the machinery for mixing and filling in.
She has added that there is no other inspection activity at the moment.
Earlier this week, inspectors declared that they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, indicated the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OIC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the unity of Safira was one of the two sites that the OIC inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the Executive Committee of the OIC.
I welcome the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult task ever undertaken by this organisation, the Director-General of the organisation Ahmet Uzumu, in a comment published by the OIC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Monitoring Centre said that there was a sharp explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Labekia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he added.
Columbia's sentence against one of Bali's Dictators
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence passed on the last conspiracy of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shooted by a landmark.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years fleeing as one of Southeast Asia's most sought-after men, was sentenced yesterday to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in manufacturing explosive machinery used in attacks.
He could be released after 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two night boxes in Kuta's popular tourist district, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injured.
He has also been convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of imprisonment, but they could have asked for man, called the Demilitation Man, to be a man for his reputation as an expert in manufacturing bombs, to be sentenced to death.
The decision rekindled painful memories for Ja Corteen, a mother of Peth who lost his two men of 39, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction carried out by Peatek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have gone along the same path as other men.
It should be brought to the front of the executing country, as Mrs Corteen said to the APP.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren or my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in an external gang, exploded just after 23 hours on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddyi Bar when a suicide bomber sacked a sack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank in the coma after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should have had the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage in Amrozi, Muklas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Maintaining it in life, why there is no reason to keep it alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not a lot.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces kill former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with a view to re-establishing links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
He did not attend, Mrs Corteen added.
Until recently, he made a mockery of the grief that he had been able to cause to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
There will be many platitudes this year, Mrs Corteen.
However, Patek may call for his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not pass an appeal with their mobile phones)
Passengers' passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music, but not talk about their mobile phones in accordance with the new, very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another, declared the FAA's administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated training manuals for crew members and rules on the fitting of aircraft to comply.
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
On the basis of the plan, we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon, which indicated the FAA in a statement.
At present, passengers must switch off their smartphones, tablets and other appliances as soon as the air gates are closed.
They are not supposed to raller them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to extinguish their appliances at the plane's descent before the landing, and not to rash them until the plane has been cleared.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use their appliances during takeovers, landing and rotation, declared FAA.
Most new airplanes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi to higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Lwill Glading, Chairman of the Association of Profesonal Flight Attenders, has been happy with these changes.
Once the new policy is implemented safely and we are going to work closely with the carriers for this, it will benefit everyone, explained Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like watchdogs in the Chamber when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet for surfing, exchange emails and SMS, or download data below 10 000 feet, declared the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft on an aeroplane.
So, still not Words With Friends, the Smarbble-style game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his marshphone in 2011, when he was deported to high noise from an American Airlines plane after refusing to extinguish his appliance while the aircraft was kept at the door.
And heavier appliances such as laptops will always have to be kept, because they could injure someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory power on mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communication Commission and not to FAA.
The FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during takeovers and landing.
Last month Mark Rorenker of the National Transportation Boards, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered a risk.
Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they may create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone networks if they are used on board, said Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee created by FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government allows a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased over recent years to relax restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claus McCastle, D-Mo, argue that there is no valid safety reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of appliances has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget about switching their appliances, or deliberately doing so.
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996, following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, then-tech gadgets.
New online aircraft rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi to cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified planes to host Wi-Fi systems are also resisting interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow for the wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, which has been declared Huerta.
Today's electronic devices typically emit far lower radio transmissions than previous generations of appliances.
Electronic books, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when one turns a page.
But transmissions are stronger when download equipment or data are sent.
Amaz.com is one of those who lobby for relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders commissioned a line of e-mails of electronic books Kindle and steered it to see if there were problems, but there were none.
This has inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee for mixed feelings about whether or not the use of appliances presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passers said he believed that interference from appliances was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicating that appliances can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorises pilots to ask passengers to switch their appliances during landing to instruments under low visibility.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for sensible arrangements to be made for passengers with technology.
We are pleased that the FAA recognises that pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security, has declared Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A Blinded Choice of a North Sea Platform was released in nature
A bird, hobbled after having been exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, has been released in nature.
The rank of water was raised on a helicopter to Aberdeen last month before he was returned to the Scottish SPCA in his Alla rescue centre.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water rank was probably a thieving migration from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.
It seems that the exhausted bird would have succeeded in finding refuge on the oil platform.
He added: he was unable to get bogged down again, so we were contacted to help.
The water rank was healthy when he was released.
Is the European elite prepared to do business with Britain?
The Business for Brittany campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and to define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most complete investigation of British entrepreneurs and asked what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGoogle interrogated more than 1 000 entrepreneurs, generally representing all sizes of business, sectors, and regions in Britain.
The conclusions of the inquiry will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that are modernizing and developing while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritizing new trade links with countries like China, India, and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcane.
When they are asked for their opinion on specific political points ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws, the majority of entrepreneurs believe that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area, 40% of the large, traditionally most pro-European companies even agree.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and to develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all the large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a significant change in the direction of power in the United Kingdom.
The stakes are high for the treaty to be changed and for Britain's interests to be better represented by a 16% shift in votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt just one moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate Britain's membership terms to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to represent the interests of British companies better, since the euro area is committed to closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be given to employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our investigation show, for businesses it means putting a new emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
The United States of Hallween
In the US, President Obama has not deviated from Hallween's tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed fridges to hundreds of children invited in the White House jargon in Washington.
Last year, Hallween's festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled because of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the celebrations have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumes took part in the parade organised in the "Greenwich village."
Everyone is excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was able at last to put my own house in order last year.
We are amused as mad, adding Rhonda.
People are happy.
It is a good child, it is cool.
We really need this.
Hallween is a celebration celebration celebrated on the eve of Tousaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that Bulgaria's gas pipeline is not a new era of gas.
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, declared the Director of Gazprom.
A historic event has taken place today: construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest project in Europe, the largest project in Europe, explained Alexei Miller, the Director-General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the whole continent of Europe.
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his Ukrainian counterpart, a country through which most of Russia's gas goes to Europe, increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are being eliminated forever.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced tariff as soon as the whole project is in operation in 2015.
Gazprom has indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Titcaine wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairen wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced on Thursday the New Year's Task Force, containing Radio Australia's news.
This island, in the east of the Gambian Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British Pacific in the South Pacific, half way between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the maimed of the Boutty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen people, most of them descendants of the Buddhist maimed, live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which is 836,000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcain, believes that creating such a protected area would be a first step toward greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the UK to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided that it had the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or several aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where military surveillance vessels are placed.
France, for its part, has already had to carry out the very costly air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of French Polynesia, a neighbour of Pitcairn.
The FAA relaxes restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft, but it will always be forbidden to pass on calls on mobile phones.

Prison for a former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin in north-east China was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded by the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having affected more than 19 million yuan-bribes, reporting the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jiin, a public establishment, helped companies and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared the first interim court in Beijing on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with "mosques" - subservient officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former executives of oil giant Petrochia.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after serving the highest functions within the state.
But the government has shown no intention of reforming the corruption-fighting system by creating an independent party body for example.
Two of the YMA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA employees of South Wales have been accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations against the educator of Caringbach, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a royal Commission hearing on child sex abuse.
But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression on children in its organisation.
Director General Phillip Hre has been questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMA has been accused of infringing child pornography and a physical educator of the YMCA Caringbach Hall was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the centre where he was working in 1991.
Mr Hare said to Gail Furness, a lawyer advising the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening declaration of the YMCA was inaccurate by underlining, the external controls of the YMCA have been carried out and indicated that the safety of children is an absolute priority for the organisation.
It has been demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the worse seconds of four institutions in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communications carried out in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who started working in the YMA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had omitted to check that employees knew they were obliged to report any breach of child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years in which he worked in the YMA.
He was sentenced to a six-year prison sentence.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings to the safety of children.
The staff have testified that they have observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with children, that he kept them in private, that they were sitting on his knees, told them that he loved and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was surrounded by Lord and had asked for training in child protection, because she was worried about her behaviour, indicated that she was responsible for YMA Caringbah's childhood services, Jacta Barnat, who would encapsulate Lord, who is very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.
The Director-General said that he rejected the staff testimonies that they were reluctant to point out these shortcomings to their hierarchical superiors.
Instead, he said that his friendly relations with Lord have blurred their judgment, which means that they have not reported his actions.
Mr Hare said that he had expressed his view before the South Wales Council of South Wales that, for the organisation, the lesson of the incident of the Jonathan Lord of the European Parliament should not be about reporting by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreements to staff, shortly after the allegations were made, was taken by the Director General of the YMA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence, but that it was an excess of zeal and that it had been poorly implemented.
South Wales's YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were serious problems in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister, but he recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old man made his views known about various national policies.
Since its inception in June 2007, after a decade at the head of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When he was asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have responded, according to the London Standard: Yes, of course, but it may happen, so...
When many pundits met in Cardiff to confront and win the Heval throne of the year, they knew that competition would be rude.
But no one expected to win Fenon Kirchester, a three-year-old child.
Not yet in school, and only a few months after its first weapons, the tiny and Setland Texee pony trotted out in the three rounds with a great ease and won the first prize, leaving the 30 other adult competitors behind them.
The two inseparable elements of the same size were welcomed for presentation, attitude and style during the annual contest in the Hénard Sunnybank, Rudy near Cardiff.
By standing up against men and women in elegant hats, he had a flat-rate hat on the sidelines in disenfranchising his two-year-old Texe pony.
Menrad was praised by judges for his natural qualities of uncommon design for a child of his age.
And Toffe received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Mentane was given a gift for his 3rd birthday last March, and has been on his Shetland pony every day.
Her mother Donna, 30 years old, said: 'Flying and Toffe are doing an excellent job.
They have stood up to and against all, but both have flowed the gold and rocket cuts.
It was only the second time he was working with Toffe and we were fond of his victory.
On the pistol, people who did not know it thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take photographs with him.
This young boy, the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbow Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the traces of his giant Sharon Hellells, who has been involved in quiet competitions for more than 10 years.
Mrs Hellells said: there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it.
He walked across the length of the runway, and even if he seemed to be tiny, he did a wonderful job.
There is a festival of animals which admits horses, tractors and rural areas and has two chickens.
In the way he started, he will certainly be taking part in the Cheval event of the year, and I am sure he will make a good job.
A spokesperson for the annual questionnaire has said: 'There is only three years to go, but he knows how to lead his pony.
They are a good team.
Judges have noted that Fenon and Toffée are well-known and the way in which they have defaulted on the runway.
They are looking for effective team work between the pony and the Professor Fenon and Toffée, who were the best on the runway.
I am sure his fine clothes helped Mr Menon, he really was proud.
A Chinese newspaper that has launched an appeal is going to be reworked.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is going to be reworked, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now the New Express is going to undergo a complete overhaul, declared the regulator.
The order of business is redesigned from the Guangddon administration for Presse and Exdition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, published a number of incorrect articles on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
The drafting of New Express was disorganised, as the regulator said in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible in New Express and immediately revisit the head of the newspaper.
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities of a shipyard manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper issued a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he had published false stories about money.
In this case, I damaged Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence, he said to the public television network CCTV.
I did so mainly because I was running after money and celebrities.
I have realised my mistake.
Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express published his apologies on the first page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
A number of important suspects have recently made television avows.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to do their own thing, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year to ban the authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
Charles de Gaulle's aircraft carrier 'unavailability'
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is back.
The leaking of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear heaters in Charles de Gaulle in mid-October, while the ship was at sea, was "safe for seamen," but it is not without consequences for the Marine.
Indeed, the Royal has confirmed to us "the inavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take appropriate corrective action" on the reactor.
For its part, the SNC company, a naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, who are dispatched in the Var for the occasion, 'are now on the aircraft carrier'.
For them, among other things, it is a question of changing an appus on failing heaters.
'Everything is being done to ensure that Charles de Gaulle can make his planned deployment at the end of 2013 ', but that is the reason for DCNS.
And the National Marine will certify that "this does not call into question the ship's program of nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier is coming from a six-month interval period.
He had dressed in Toulon in mid-October for training.
In particular, in order to qualify the young hunting pilots.
A small conflagration, confined to the site of containment of the reactor, took place on the amicable ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of the people I encounter: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a flood of taxes, a cost of all sorts of licences, and administrative costs.
In short, there is no limit on our pockets.
Millions of dollars will be saved in order to allow a much-respected tax to pay.
Any money taken away from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Sawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we are not bothered about somptuous expenditure and the maintenance of lame ducks: a deficient cultural centre, a strong subsidy to the City of Energy, and so on.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to private companies or they are demolished.
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I would like to mention the transformation of the old Wabasso into some sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the tax payers?
It is not for public works to invest in such companies, but for the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
The citizens have been pleased to learn that lakes in Fisheries and Pilles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (large water users) and large population decline, the use of water has fallen considerably across the territory.
Without wanting to waste it, the city will never miss water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly watered down.
In short, it is easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without a loan regulation.
For more than 40 years, we have been dealing with festivals with great qualifications for most, and I do not believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse.
Opening up a drugs tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own systems of lighting, ventilation and electrical rails, has been discovered.
The US authorities described the 4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on the equivalent of nearly six long football grounds, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, in the United States.
The area is full of unmanageable warehouses, which makes it easy to conceal drug-dealing trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs came out of it, and the authorities declared themselves to be.
The authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to legal records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers, were charged with the possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intention of selling.
They run a prison sentence of 10 years for life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, in Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in the centre of Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that quickly supply their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage from around 700 yards fitted with railway lines that were leaking from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two warehouses San Diego.
The British police are issuing an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who spoke at the Ecuador Ambassador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said that it had issued an opinion of surrender against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be able to be arrested.
Assange may be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting every possible avenue under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated its appeal against its extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm allows its transfer to the United States, it found refuge in the Ecuador Ambassador in London on 19 June, calling on this country of South America to grant political asylum.
Scotland Yard has issued an opinion against a 40-year-old man who is asking him to present himself to a police station, at the time and time of his choice, has declared a spokesman.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail-out.
The Ambassador refused to comment on issuing the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, having unveiled more than 250 000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics will Survive our lives
Is it the case that the words' tampering 'are used to gain access to his sporphone or to pay for his purchases?
American, French, or Japanese researchers predict a future in which we will be recognised by the biometric captors of telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Managing Director of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in such a transverse and transnational universe as the Internet.
Organisations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are worried about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Data and Information Commission authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the form of hand or the feeble network of hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
'Everyone will soon be identified, anywhere and wherever ', moved to Justin Brookman, who is responsible for the privacy of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the bypass of the hand and the infettered network of breaks or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work in concrete have the fingers, and their fingerprints are illegible," Philippe Robin Robin, the technical director of the identity field in the Thai Communications & Securité.
And the collection and verification of the feeble network and the hand of the hand implies a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
It is both security - we cannot capture this data at home - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as recognition of face or iris (the collusion part of the eye).
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the captors and the ability to compute the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of face recognition has multiplied by ten in the last five years, calculating Cyrile Bataller, the director of the R & D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an iris on the move.
"Today, we are carrying out research on the recognition of the voice or on how to walk with sonar captors, but there needs to be a silent environment," says Sridar Iygear, the head of security research in Intel Labs.
A single and infallible Marquer, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data," confirming Sophia Vulliet-Teavera, director of studies, innovation, and foresight in CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and expensive.
NEC is proposing to the judicial police a worth of EUR 90,000 to analyse samples of DNA in the place of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics spread into two groups: identification (recognising one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the one she claims to be).
The identification concerned the issuing of identity papers: the biometric identifiers (fingerprinting, photographs, irrigation) have to be confronted with the information that the state has on all citizens who have already been established.
This makes it possible to ensure that someone does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIII in the entry of a hotel or a shop.
"We are reclaiming images of supervisory cameras and comparing them to the photographs of celebrities freely circulating on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for commercial development for biometric identifiers in NEC France.
Another use: to photo a quash that queued in a shop, to follow its progress through facial recognition and to calculate waiting times.
Genuine authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening up a computer).
More recently, there was the monitoring of attendance.
'A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of Cophia which is leading to another ', justifies Cyrile Bataller, Accension.
More and more, however, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those carried out from Internet-related appliances.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing its card and by putting its hand on a biometric reader: this is a move away from the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villenne-Ascq and Angaitself by the Natural Security Society in partnership with banks and teachers of the large distribution: when paying in shop with its banking card, the customer does not tap his code, but he finger at a reader who scanns the vets.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If it is successful, biometric readers may soon reach French traders.
Solutions to reassure users
There are three ways of making biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains fat 30 seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years' time, a voice server can recognise your voice and propose tailor-made options.
Finally, I would like to reassure you by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
'fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are on a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure bogeyman who is blocking if he is trying to move it ', including Philippe Robin, Thales.
But, because there are no detailed studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The specialists in the protection of privacy continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flikr or Piaca, cause me to fear the worst: widespread surveillance," Andrew Patrick, of the Commission's private-life commission in Canada.
A driver travelling at 210 km / h with a hot drink between legs has been given an amalgam of £1 000.
A driver has been fined £1 000 for having rushed to 210 km / h with a hot drink that is balanced in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years from Tiptree in Essex, was repressed leading his Mercedes Benz on the A120 height of Brainmee on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the bedroom of his legs.
At the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the breach of conduct without the prudence and attention required.
The seven points withdrawn on his licence have led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie has also been sentenced to pay costs amounting to £90, and a surcharge for the victim of £100.
A tax on foreign property owners to break the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the measure of capital gains tax but expects a final decision from Mr Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, has set a 7% stamp right for properties costing more than £2, and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property within a society rather than individually.
The right of stamp already applies to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708, £708 on fiscal year 2012 / 13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest, and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: following the increase in the right of stamp on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to move forward that high value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.
But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or current homeowners reluctant to sell, he added.
Mortgage real estate accounts for 5-10% of the highest housing-market prices in the prosperous south-west of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 1.8% over the last year.
Prices in the center of London show steady growth year by year of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by an internal market that is growing in growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the (6.5%) rate of recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movement of a dog's tail is linked to its mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs were more queuing up to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while nervous dogs won more to the left.
But scientists now say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientists at the University of Trirene, said: 'Everyone knows that, in man, the left side and the right of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimuli that raise positive or negative emotions.
Here we have tried to see what it was in other species.
He added that, as in the case of humans, dogs on the brain's side were responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
In order to know more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, researchers have watched animals watching films where other dogs were.
They have measured the cardiac frequency of animals and analysed their behaviour.
It will certainly not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes comes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: 'We have presented to dogs of films where other dogs are either a naturalist version or a silver bullet to avoid any further confusion, and we have been able to manipulate the tail movement and present it as more to the left or to the right.
When the animals saw a dog without an expression waving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog that wreaked their tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they returned to the left mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog that wounded), their heart frequency accelerated and they were anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with them through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: if you meet other dogs on a number of occasions, and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their queue to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the law side has a less friendly attitude, you will react on the basis of that experience.
Researchers indicate that the results could enable owners, veterinarians, and addicts to better understand their animals "emotions.
The expert in canin John Bradshaw, a professor at the University of Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University found that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and right when it was a joyful dog.
And, in another scientific study carried out by Victoria University in Canada, he said: "dogs are flying more easily to a robot dog when their tail wins to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming ancestral, the opposite of what is in the Italian study.
He pointed out that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs that took part in the various studies did not fully regard the animals of films or robots as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
Although many elements, raised in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are no exception, he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Artic Monkeys is back in Glasgow as a result of Alex Turner's disease
The rock group Artic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after a llarnatt was diagnosed to his singer.
The Swiefeld group was due to take place on Friday in the Hydo concert in the centre.
However, his lynchrate forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group had been forced to postpone a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Artic Monkeys stated: following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena de Birmingham this evening and after requesting medical advice, the Artic Monkeys must also postpone the spectacle to the Hydroo de Glasgow on Friday 1 November.
Alex Turner suffers from a lynch and regrets that he cannot be allowed to happen in concert.
The spectacle of Birmingham in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the Hydo de Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologise to all the ticket holders for any discomfort caused.
Thank you for contacting the customer service to the ticket where you bought your tickets for any additional assistance.
Pope Francis will nominate his first dinners in February
Pope Francis will name new cardinings of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinal men are the highest-ranking men in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so François will nominate his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals at present.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a Pope, so it is a group of 120 cardinal dinners.
In a statement announcing the news, Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting with all the existing cardinings would take place before the ceremony in which bishops are raised to the dignity of Cardinal, known as conspiracy.
Pope François has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consensus in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of Cardinal Cardinal Parties in various parts of the world, declared Lombardi.
Jack Valalo of Catholics has said that by February the number of voters will probably fall.
He said that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinal cardinings as he needed to get the number of voters to reach 120 and so many cardinals over 80 years old.
The conspiracy of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and, in particular, Italy.
It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will name cardinals in the rest of the world to restore balance, he has added.
Forty per cent of Roman Catholic Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinings represent them.
Cardinal cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on his own.
Now François has chosen these eight cardinal cardinings to help him, explained Valero.
He added that it was entirely possible for Francis to be asked for advice.
But we have never seen such a situation, it is completely new.
Valero pointed out that the Pope typically raised bishops representing large communities as a cardinal, but François was full of surprises, so we do not know who he will name.
GM recalls some of its new pipes in the United States to repair the dossier of seats.
General Motors Co recalls almost 19 000 of his new Cherolls Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to deal with a problem with banner files, according to a statement on Friday by the US body responsible for regulating vehicle safety.
On some pickupps, the seats before they could present a defect at the level of the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the dossiers do not comply with the federal safety standards for motor vehicles.
If the vehicle is permeated by the back, it may well be that its head does not adequately protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury, according to the declared statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTRSA).
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pipes started in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed homeowners of default in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16-day ruling of government activities, which slowed down the growth in vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickubps Silverado and Sierra, which were redrawn for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, declared GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickubps Silverado and 16 503 pickubps Sierra.
GM stock prices rose by 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies entanglei under concrete blocks.
A construction worker died in dozens of concrete blocks, on Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The tragedy took place at 11 a.m., on the Marquette street, near the intersection of the Beautiful street, in the Rosema-Petite-Patrie dam.
In all probability, work on the foundations has been taking place there for some time.
A mighty foundation wall had been erected over the last few days.
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had arrived on the site in order to recover his tools.
I was travelling by car and saw the wall collapse with a huge smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the site.
I am landed and I went to remove the big bricks that would be recovered.
We saw only one part of her back, that is so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the fifty who worked for a coffers.
Resuscitation tactics have been attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man has not survived his serious injuries.
A Commission inspector on health and safety at work was sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
Obama's Drink of desperation
I voted twice for President Obama, who believed in the possibility of change.
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts with the Republican Party's obstructionism
Oblivenisation does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the attacks on drones.
The memory of Obama's 2008 Campaign is a sad reminder of what might have happened.
Nathanel P. Morris is studying in 2nd year of medicine at Harvard Medical Medicine.
I am reading a sad book in the past few days.
It is a book which I thought would encourage me during the morale of the 2nd year of medicine and would give me hope.
It is called The Audasity to Win, and these are the memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I look at it, this book brings me back to the time when politicians inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut you off.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory, and the prestigious newspaper presenters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades have been joking and my parents have kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period in 2008, he had 82% of favorable views.
And then I am closing the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening; it is like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days of optimism, it is like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change actually took place in the years after which I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put Obama's credit to Obama for great achievements, since the passage from the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, to the end of the story, neither seen nor known to be the case and the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantánamo, among other things.
But, having repeatedly defended Obama's administration in the face of my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, or attacks on innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of the Americans, or the indictment of whistleblowers revealing the misdeeds of the government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, and the evasion of public funding and the exceeding of expenditure permitted during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that states that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are the more aggressive ones... since the administration of Nixon.
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I do not know if that is what I expected.
If, at 18 years, I were supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that take place by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed appear to be largely the choice of administration.
That is what disturbs me most.
I once again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, who was elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would deliver the promises that he had been hearing for so long.
Yet, while the favorable index of opinion has fallen by 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
I am not happy with the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses for Clinton to the Primaylvania Primayers.
At a post-campaign meeting he told his team that they had to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
I want us to focus on our own talent, he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years ago, Mr President, I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathanel Morris.
On Friday, at 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place from Retina to Flélon.
The late Jonathan, 26 years of Flélon, was not wearing a cascade.
Despite rapid relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
The billionaire Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his girls could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining-mining tycoon, which denies the payment of a carbon tax of $6, has put this argument in order to try to sidestep questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr Abbott's girls were prepared to benefit personally from these policies.
It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave, because if one of its girls is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in whether or not it gets a life leave, as Mr Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast de Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr Palmer has put forward the idea of a reshuffle of the suffrage system to speed up the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Francis and Bridglet.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
We need a better system, he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, use your coordination in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6.30 p.m. the next morning?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of paper bases to mark the ballot papers.
Is it to be possible to delete the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a paper bogus seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied possible options with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59 years, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office very seriously.
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
We are not seeking reward, except for the reward of history, because we must serve the community at a critical time, he has added.
A biologist team led by the Wildlife Social Society Society in New York identified a new type of boy dolphin off Australia's northern coast.
Thibaux Bopenoux, charged with a scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for Conservation and Academy of Animals and Migrants (OCEMMM), is the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does it surprise you that this new type of bovine dolphin is discovered?
This is good news, but it is not particularly surprising.
Whereas in the past species have been described and identified on the basis of morphlogical, anatomic and geographical, today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge of the classification of species.
Moreover, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to challenge the classification or membership of a species of a kind, a family, or even a order.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, morphologists classified animals, based on the moral differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being called into question due to the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two species that are very close to morphologically have been distinguished by genetic engineering.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this sub-family: the Pacific bosses and the Atlantic bosses.
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society said?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only in that place.
Therefore, if a mass mortality problem caused by a viral epidemic or accidental catch occurs in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a species that is more widespread on earth.
This loss of genetic inheritance would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered by the number of people on Earth, that is to say the stock, and the possibility of recovering from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the Seychelles species, whose population of the new discovered species has come to an end, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new marine mammals?
Marine mammals are situated at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals.
This breed of genes restricts the creation of new species.
On the contrary, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually create new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, to know what is going on in Mariannes, only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time that this changed.
RBS suspended two traders in the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its exchange-rate division according to two sources close to the dossier, which shows once again that regulators "global survey of suspicions of currency manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world's most important financial market investigations, where $5.3 trillion is changing every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of the expansion of the investigation, which reflects the scandal of the manipulation of the interbank rate Libor.
The bank, which refused to comment on suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators, said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had transmitted files and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Contact Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his post as a European capital-counting officer in JPMorgan.
Rhanan Ramchandani, a European official for exchange-rate swings in Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a currency senior at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been charged with charges.
Mr Usher's dossier included instant messages sent to and by bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the dossier.
UBS explained this week that it had acted against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that he investigated suspicions of manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities in the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are examining allegations about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange rates on the exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, have indicated sources close to the dossier.
Banks shy away from instant messages and emails that have been sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment banks in the last few years, but has been called into question this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader has said that, despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms is the reason why it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost.
The news came on the same day that the Crégé Switzerland announced that it had sent a trader working in his own fund office to the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of six dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been controlled by a representative of the Swiss Credit Crégé.
The investigation of Mayor Rob Ford has been blocked, supports a lawyer
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford fudged the crash, Me Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen such a botched investigation.
Med Ruby said in Press Cadania that the police had "ignored or minimized" evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested the occasional friend and driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion in relation to video.
Alexander Lisi, who was previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police have said that they have also observed this man issuing the collates at Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Med Ruby called it "inexplicable" that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that the police chief Bill Blair chose to do nothing against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could have intercepted the vehicle of Rob Ford, arrested the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a mandate.
It could also have called for an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The head of the police has not commented, but his spokesman Mark Pugabh has described Me Ruby's words as "clear and desperate attempt" to press the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In the press conference, on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be 'reasonable grounds' that could lead to a criminal accusation against the mayor.
The European Stock Exchange in the middle of the sitting, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are falling on Friday in mid-session, overshadowed by some new disappointing companies, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious, because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could end its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
Conversely, after inflation announced at 0.7% for the eurozone as a whole, the idea is spread among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street suggests that US actions will be opened up, after two consecutive consecutive sessions.
To the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest retrenchment of CAC 40, overshadowed by the warning of its partner Nissan Moitor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, having also published declining results this morning and announced the creation of a charity structure ("bred bank") that brings together 38 billion of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafa (+ 2.45%) keeps at the top of EuroFirst300's rise in response to press information that AT & T is exploring a possible takeover bid.
In the exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy has shown, in Saxo Bank.
The ECB's sole mandate has always been inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to take action at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro is continuing its retreat against the US currency and has affected in the sitting a further two weeks to 1.3517 dollar.
The same conjecture, in contrast, supports the eurozone bond market.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama health-care reform law
Great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court said today that Obama's health-reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (law on the protection of patients and affordable care), which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014, otherwise they will have to pay a fine and have declared that it is constitutional under the government's power of taxation.
The Supreme Court president, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Scilia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy judges expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2 700 pages Act and, furthermore, considered that the provision of the health-care reform law, which states that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered under the pain of losing all federal funding of the programme, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Trade of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates for the presidential election in the 2012 primaries, including the nominee designate Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the law.
Trading to former combatants in Menon
At the heart of the Traquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, made a tribute, this Friday afternoon, to the soldiers and defendants of all wars.
Sovests have been deposited in two of the three military cemeteries of the cemetery by Mr Jean-Claude Guial and various personalities.
Crossing between Palestinians and Israelis on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday 31 October 2013 at the night of a violent hang on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power station in the Gaza Strip ceased to function on Friday 1 November after its fuel stocks were exhausted, announced the Energy Authority of the Palestinian enclave.
A local commander of the Bogades Ezzédidin Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another framework of Hamas's armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a shellfish shells fired at an Israeli army incursion to the east of Khan Younès, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials in the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud died when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli hair and a blunt bulldozer carried a 100-metre incursion into the territory before then withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died in confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Al Qassam heroes who have fallen by defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," threatened the spokesman.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a broad tunnel that has been widened in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, to "terrorist activities."
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to abduct Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas unleashed an explosive bogeyman to the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israel in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," as the spokesman of the Peter Lerner army has indicated.
On the other hand, Israel has struck an air-based military base in north-west Syria, aimed at a shipment of missiles aimed at Lebanon's Shiite Shiite movement, reported on Thursday 31 October the Al-Arabiya satellite chain.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike," but did not give details of the target.
"In the past, targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," but only added.
Those responsible for the Israeli Government have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
As a result of the "exclusive sources" that it has not named, the Saudi capital channel has indicated that "the bombing has targeted a cargo of ground missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at the dawn of an air defender in Sonar Jabé, near Lahatté, on the Syrian coast.
This organisation based on a network of militants and medical sources was unable to identify the origin of the explosions.
In black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents Danes Danes with his two new group centrifuges: the first inspired by Henri Michelle's encages and poems, the second insuffqué by the famous Boano Symnarides of Sophia.
An evening that allows Chouinard's prism, art, and black ink to be seen in white.
A white screen serves as a wall of substance.
On the carpet, however white, in the vast space of the theatre Mairing, in advance, in a profile, an end like a black line and dress, a body.
On the screen, Henri Michelu's ink is projected.
The body, which is simple, takes its form.
And this form will be the whole coin: a enactment of physical imitation of designs.
The dansors, who are full of black and white, only their hands and face face, are waiting on each side of the game, are rushing when the next appearance appears, embodied, in the dark.
Henri Michelle's black and white game is being relaxed by soils, in a united grouping (mass mass), in large group of twelve soils, where everyone carries out his or her mark.
We are thinking of 'Glory of the morning', where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of written chorus tasks on cartels, put on the front line.
This is the same principle, the giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, peremotive, and electric.
Energy is high, the pace is fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prior takes refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, microphone, without sobriety or restraint, part of the poem of Michelle, monocormonde, and monotone in the critique, and will continue dancing.
And the music restarts, and the sequence of sequence.
This sound and energetic discharge, if possible, ends up drying up and depressing.
This is also true of the regularity of the visual pace.
There are a few fine flashpoints - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - such as those hair-splitting horses or black tissues that extend the lines.
But the chorus approach lacks composition.
It is the impression that the chorus, instead of going to meet the work of Michelles, has imposed itself, with its fleets.
As a result, the bodies seem to be at loggerheads in front of the drawings.
Michelat's henchmen, like forms of Gestalt, are opening up a wider and more gigantic imagination than dancing.
Only the end, in negative terms, with its haddock dachers in a stratospheric light and white signs in a sudden black theatre, is a magic wand.
The public loved, received warm reception.
The Gymnagedia, after the event, is richer.
The scene is, in part, flags of grey, dancing and piano are covered by tissues, such as furniture in a left house.
At the piano, dancing danced to play the game.
Their touchy music addresses give real fragility.
On the ground, they spend couples, dubbed duos, very sensational, even erotic.
Trafficking in small groups, a small number of transitions, which are moving around, shocking, writing is less binary.
There seem to be buoyant people, including Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in very polarized male-female parades.
The amorums are carnadoes, fugitives or players.
Desperation, rivals, and small cries transcend the archaic archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the cooking bodies, the people who are based.
But the coin takes his real flight after salvation.
A clown is on the scene when the public leaves.
Here, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the world's exploded universe is superseded, drunken dances, descending among spectators, glossy, smoking, circumventing, playing applause codes, sowing the seeds in a well-calculated mess that remains senseless.
Joy and folly transpired, and this is the art of Chouinard, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings concerning the Nortel patents
The group that has thousands of former patent patents started an avalanche of legal proceedings on patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, particularly Google, the company that it hastened to the pole at the auction auction that took place after the collapse of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5, has lodged complaints against Samsung Electricks Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other patent-breach companies before the US Court of Assurance in Texas.
Rockstar is held jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be advertised on the Internet, have indicated the findings of the trial, which is the heart of Google's occupation.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC produce telephones operating under the Android operating system of Google, which is fiercely competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its supply several times, in the end to offer $4.4.
After losing the Nortel patent against Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Moody's Mobiliary for a sum of $12.5, a market in part based on Motora's patent library.
Although it has failed in its attempt to acquire patents at auction, Google has violated and continues to violate such patents, indicated the findings of the trial.
Rockstar calls for greater damages against Google, because it claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the plaintiff.
Housing a house in Gesves: a defective driver at the root of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas flight.
The explosion of an inhabitation in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and his five-year-old grandson, was due to a flight of gas from a defective heater, last Friday evening the replacement of the King of the King.
The expert posted on the spot by the prosecutors ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a flight and a gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of both victims is still committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is seriously burnt.
The small boy, who was in his grandfather and his companion, was on his side and was burnt more slightly.
"The two victims were intuitive and long conditioned on the ground before being taken to the CHU of Liège, the helicopter, ambulance," specified the quagmire José Paulet, descending on the scene.
Mamamatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Sain and except, he was able to join the floor by the estateau remained intact while the home wall was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenants of the neighboring house, undermined by the explosion, have been relegated by the President of the CPAS.
The fire-fighters in Andalusia and Namur and the Arches police have intervened.
The civil protection of Cristian stabilised both buildings.
Egypt is asking the first freely elected president to lend his oath.
Mohamed Morsi lent the inauguration serath, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflict in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a new Egypt when he lent the inaugural serath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak, who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He sworn in front of the Court's 18 black bosses whose building on the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, declared President Morsi at the formal ceremony broadcast on public television.
Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life for absolute freedom, true democracy and stability, explained to Mr Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer formed in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal organisation that has been severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, a local hour, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred fans had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, starting with the presidential good presiding over the Mubarak years, movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy to the very crowded streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Given that the Muslim Brotherhood's little charismatic help, its personal prestige has increased considerably since its victory and Friday's speech in which it tried to portray itself as the candidate not only of Islamists, but of all those who want to end the work begun in the 2011 uprising against President Mubarak's authoritarian regime.
Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state, and has declared Mohamed Morsi, in blue collar and red-clad suits, to be the judge who is present in the bishop room in which he has lent his oath.
Later, Mr Morsi went to Cairo University where he gave his inaugural speech.
He was officially received by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was on the alert.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was greeted by the song of the people and the army, hand-in-hand... with thousands of people gathered in the great theatre of university.
In 1908, and a former stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became a fiefdom of Islamist student groups in the 1970 "s.
Mr Morsi made a symbolic sworn on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year, and he sworn the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former evouted president, deowned him.
But, by agreeing to lend formally to the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he warns against the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square accompanied dramatic populist gestures.
The Lshutdown in the US has impeded the rise in the car market.
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the six main performing countries performed below expectations.
The three major Detroit manufacturers have double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
The analysts averaged an average of 15.4 million sales at an annualized rate and corrected seasonal variations, but the market was set at 15.3 million, according to Adam Jonas's analyst, Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's clients, he believes that this slight brake is primarily due to "government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first half of the month."
GM, however, reported an increase of nearly 16% in sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expectations of consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their trade performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from its peak peak, has seen its sales move from 14% over one year to 191 985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194 301.
Chrysler, meanwhile, controlled by Fiat announced an 11% increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also exhibit less than consensus, despite increases in one year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
In the New York Stock Exchange, GM was earning 1.4% at 16.35 GMT while Ford was yielding 1.1%.
In the wake of the Nissan warning, Renault overshadowed the Stock Exchange.
In Friday, Renault accuses the largest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that he had cut the annual net benefit forecast by nearly 20%, reporting traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of his direction.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by 'warening'.
"It is clearly Nissan's warring profit," says a trader of a parisian broker.
Within the framework of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan capital and Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to the Nissan Web site.
Greece: two deaths in a shooting near a local neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by fire fired by two people who were on board a motorway who went to a local neo-Nazi party in the west of Athens, has been taught from police sources.
The police were not in a position at the moment to provide information on the identity of victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn members had argued that the victims were guards from their local offices.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, depending on the same source.
Counterfeiting police officers have fled to the central nucleus of the suburbs of Néo Iraqi, where the incident took place and closed the neighbourhood.
The incident takes place a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn Members, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organisation" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
The Coup of Mr Brown rejected
The Captain of Celtic Glasgow, the Captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two League Chairs of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Exploited against Barça for a coup d'état in Nymar, the Scottish middle saw its extended suspension at three meetings by UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club said 'very disappointed', believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50 000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after midday, due to the violent winds affecting many regions along the Saint Laurent River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15 042 abundated people in the black, Montestre with 13 464 and the Uighur with 8642.
The large region of Montreal also has a lot of blackouts with almost 7,000 private households in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought that travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Center seems to be overturning the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts and hopes for record results thanks to the vacancies of Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expecting to make an underlying profit on the whole exercise between 325 and 340 dollars before taxes, against a previous forecast of 305 to 315 M.
If current predictions are reached, it will represent 12 to 17% of growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011 / 12.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Center had achieved 8% of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had begun in force, particularly with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are well on the way to achieving record results on the whole exercise before deducting interest and taxes, he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the recreational travel sector rekindled during the second half of the year, making it possible to compensate for a domestic market in lightly reduced business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Travel Center has produced good results while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year in which seasonal demand was lower and had to benefit from the whole exercise for the third consecutive time.
The Flight Centre's actions increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Innovations on a hotel near Cairo's pyramids
Unknown inmates opened the fire on a hotel near the Cairo pyramid in Egypt on Friday without causing casualties, as a result of an apparent dispute with workers made redundant.
The sponsors have fled, specified the spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior, General Abdel Latif.
This attack comes at a time when Egypt is receiving almost no tourists since the army dismissed the Islamist president Mohamed Morsi early in July and represses the protests of his followers in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In English literature, pupils will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, a romantic poem, and contemporary British fiction work of 1914.
The review will also present new texts to encourage a more diversified reading.
A combination of literature and English language will be removed.
Starting from 2015, pupils will have to switch to an independent CESR, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and Maths programmes tomorrow as the first subjects to undergo radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
Moreover, Ofqual, the regulator's regulatory bureau, will reveal a reshaping of the structure of the CSR, with a new credit rating system and lower prices.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was broad consensus on the need to reform our system of examinations to restore public confidence, insisting that the CSR would be more stimulating, more ambitious, and more rigorous.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours a year, 3 hours a week during school year) than most other countries.
By contrast, Australian schools are offering on average 143 hours a year, and Singapore's pupils are doing about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more hours on maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCCA of deepened mammals, as well as the greater emphasis on issues in international rankings, would probably encourage schools to ensure more hours.
The programme will place greater emphasis on the problems of the real world, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in this state, and which largely calls into question the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
A octogenarian is hosting children with a gun to the Muy in Hallween.
Origins aged 9 and 13 were wearing the door to claim sweets on the evening of Hallween.
One of the vicinity of the Muy's home, visited by children, opened the door to his hunt.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the genders he had been afraid of.
His weapon was seized.
The former Gestapo leader buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was in fact buried in a mass graveyard of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, asserting the leader of the German resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass graveyard of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured every day that he was using archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great post-war enigma.
The German secret services, the BND, ensured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were completely mistaken.
"From August 1945, the body of Müller was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of Reich by a commando," according to Mr Tuchel.
It was' a uniform uniformly '.
"In the left-wing domestic pocket, among other things, was his state of service with a photo."
Bild also published a document from the district of Mitte in Berlin that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the neighbourhood.
The President of the Central Council of German Jews, Dieter Graumann, has declared himself shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is a huge amount of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly trampled underfoot," he replied, in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures in the Third Reich who has never been caught.
He took part in the Wanne Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had, in particular, on his orders Adolf Eicchmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Pamela Anderson cut his leaflets of blue-collar peaks and takes a dramatic cavalier.
Pamela's blue button has become famous thanks to his role in the TV series Sexy Alerte in Malibu.
Pamela Anderson is the last celebrity to shock his fans with a new, dramatic hairdresser.
Alerte's ancient nana in Maliiu has left his long hair wound against a platinous quotient.
The 46-year-old shareholder unveiled his new look as she walked into L.A. Wednesday and shared a photo on her Twitter page.
This is the first time in 20 years that the beautiful blonde has been cut off, and there is a fan of discreet change.
What do you think of the Pammy hairdresser?
Tell us what you think of it in the comments that have been made.
He walks in the mud, the jungle and rivers to offer free medical assistance.
Dr Georges Bwshe disregards free healthcare in Cameroon's villages.
Dr Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend watching hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 for 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile machinery
Dr Georges Bwit is one of the 10 Huros CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect him to Héos CNN of the year.
This person will receive $250 000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwshe watched his sick father alternating periods of conscience and conscience and traveled to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
James Bwle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital.
At the beginning he had only a broken arm, but he contracted a infection that spread to his brain, creating a haematoma whose sequence was going to carry the rest of his life.
There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, who said Georges Bwit.
We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr Bwelle spent years supporting his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he would get any treatment that he could enjoy.
It is not easy, adding Mr Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 p.m., you run in hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organisation.
By way of comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctors for 413 inhabitants.
Even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroon would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health spending is carried out in the private sector.
The only problem that they have is poverty, explained Dr Bwelle.
And, because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
Having seen his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr Bwelle was determined to try to change course.
Dr Georges Bwit and his team of volunteers carried out more than 700 surgical acts free of charge during last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as vascular surgeons at the Yaoundé central hospital.
And it created a non-profit-making humanitarian association, SACOVIE, which travels to rural areas during weekends to dispense free healthcare.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32 000 people.
Almost every Friday, with around 30 people, they get into fodder after setting the medical material on the roof and crossing difficult land to go to the villages most in need of help.
The chance does not always follow them.
They have often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or botched paths.
But when they arrive, they are received by heroes: the community is holding a festival, chilling, and dancing and offering them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr Bwelle, with his great smile and pervasive energy, is more than happy to join the celebrations.
The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.
We receive 500 people on every visit, Mr Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive billboards, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate that is necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
Tonight, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anaesthetic.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, a town or a house; after the intervention, the patient is standing up and going to the playground to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrogen group, the operation room and the sterilisation of equipment, Dr Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It is a tempting pace, but village musicians usually help the team to remain motivated.
They are knocking on the wall all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work, explained Mr Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired, but proud of the work it has done.
The group, consisting of Cameroon doctors and medical students, carried out 700 surgical acts free of charge during last year, and he knows that their presence can make a difference to those who help them.
A man explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a herd would enable him to work again.
This will change my future and that of my own family, which has been said to be man.
Dr. Bwelle is also working night in private medical firms around Yaoundé in order to make this hospital live and work as surgeon in hospital.
It is this second job, it is said, that finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
I do not know when he is sleeping, he declared Kurry O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of the Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteering in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and nurses like Kaurd O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwen in his missions, it is a learning opportunity on the ground that they do not have at home.
We have been able to take part in operations to help sponge blood or pass the instruments on to Dr Bwelle, explained Miss O'Malley.
This is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a medical student in the second year.
Voluntary students usually pay their travel to Cameroon, and often arrive with the medical equipment collected.
But once Yaoundé, their pensions, transport, and education are taken care of by Dr Bwelle.
It is a hero, there is no doubt about it, and he said Kaisse O'Malley.
He gives his life to this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not nearly extinguished.
For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that gives him great joy.
I am so happy when I do this work, added Mr Bwelle.
I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain is the reason why I do this.
Please look at the ACOVIE website to see how you can help.
Pierre Nora's France
The academics have long dreamed of defining and siting Pierre Nora.
A Professor in amphibials and Praces?
Without doubt, but underscore its weak track for the roads, Sicilians-Po, Upper Etudes.
Arbitrary works of others in his street office Gaston-Gallies?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and written writing of the publisher.
Humala of the chair occupied by Fontenher to the French Academy?
Of course, but in the knowledge that such a sacred body cannot replace real holy oil, that of the theory, which has happened.
They have willingly recognised in him a great, inspiring and unifying job, but by noting that he is reluctant to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image, the monument of the "Livers of Remembrance," to which he has attached his name, has also contributed.
The bad languages have seen this as an enormous market for chips, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a great deal of sleep and thoughtlessness, but incurably diluted.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the person who went to not write had a lot and a good written writing.
The book that is now before him should be brought to justice once and for all.
Once again, however, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagage, jubilation that has been blown out of hand from one subject to another.
But it is easy to understand that disparate objects gathered in this book in so beautiful a title bring the brandier to one and the same passion: to discover the novelty of French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: that is a concern at the time.
We have been collectively invited to give it a definition.
But, in the bitter spirit of our leaders at that time, French identity was an intimate essence.
We needed only to deploy accidents, and the case, Jacobinism, was entrusted to prefects and subprefects, authorised interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is doing is quite different.
He is not a heir to eternal frankness, he is refusing to define it.
Analyst worried about a family strange, he restates in a forest of symbols, arrested every step by a rebus object, tormented by irritating questions.
Who is born of the company itself: why, in a country that is so long-term in its borders, which was formerly chartered and solidly shamed, are these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so pressing, suggesting Pierre Nora, than to conjure up the unrest born of the discord of French history.
Franks and Gaulaws, Armagnacs and Bourgignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And, of course, the most emblematic of all is the one that flies in two national history.
From the earthquake of the revolution, the French have two histories, and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; rather, it would have to regain the sacred and all the more avid unity and indivisibility that it had cut off the head of the obvious and powerful embodiment.
And, of course, an invincible binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism, and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this unique feature of French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside the Hexaggerone, so the US squandering of Pierre Nora may well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both made a revolution, drawn up a declaration of rights, wanted to build a new society.
But the US cousin only serves to underline what is our own.
There were men who left their Ancia Rée in England and no longer had any care.
Here, there are crowded men of an indigenous, and all the more radical, Axis.
This was a consensual revolution when it sowed the drama and configurated it.
Here, the founding fathers always honoured, and here revolutionary ancestors whose models are hardly worth making, and who have been killed by the rest.
This is an institutional inconsistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as mistakes to catch up and to carry out tests.
France, which is Beginning with France
Yet there was a time when the French believed that they could recoup the roadside of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
In the IIth Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora has shown a great deal of interest and even tenacity: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching schoolchildren everything in the old France was obscured by modern France, and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peacemaking identity had only one time.
This is once again being debated, culminated in a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of restive minorities, absorbed into the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France and the cautious outline of France coming.
On top of that, the portrait of historian, which should reserve some surprises.
It found that the shirt was a camel.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessively, around the same idea.
The coffers of manure were at the centre of the centre.
And the one who, over half a century ago, tabled a subject about the idea of nation, but escaped from the initial exercise of the theory, entrusts us with a grudgingly grandiose salience that he will eventually do so.
Of course, in a less rational, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But let us not deceive ourselves, just as prescriptive.
For much more than the figure imposed by the university curriculum, this theory says the internal need for a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage."
Enlifted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team filmed a demonstration by Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Since 2008, he has been involved in the creation of the "World Outcome" Association of hostages, which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for the hostages to lodge a complaint and to bring their kidnappers to the International Criminal Court.
More than 1 000 days ago, the four hostages in Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larbe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féet were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Wel Military Hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to return to their families since then.
And try, gradually, to take over the course of their lives.
'The New Observer 'asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, the former great postponement, repented since 2008, the chairman of the' World Outcome 'association.
From the evening of your release, you were on the 20th-century plateau of 'Antenne 2'.
What are your memories of your liberation today?
On the spot, in particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the coffers of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque.
He tells me 'is liberated', but I am not sure, and tell me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who drive us are also very tense.
They are putting us on the edge of a trottle.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then there is the site of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
The French are bringing us to the French embassy.
This is the time for the first wireless coups to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember having taken a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the French Embassy.
I also remember a short night discussing with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there, because we do not have the means to evacuate to the Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there in helicopters, you are taking a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boils down.
How did you arrive on French soil?
We are terrified at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It is a bit brutal.
There is an incredible amazement.
And a lot of media.
When I was there there were three television channels.
I come back and there is full.
The descent of the plane's cadir, the reunited with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Ramboui leads.
The molehards are pulling the plug to make photos and follow me up to my home where I have to do a bit of the police to prevent some of them from rising.
The media pressure is enormous.
It does not stop, we are well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it.
There is a hole, and suddenly we are in the media spotlight.
It is a little complicated, a little violent, rather complex to manage.
But we have done the hardest.
On the evening I am at 20.00, the next day, too, I am on television.
Then there is a kind of adjustment to life, very slowly, for one or two months, which is a little like holiday.
How did medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing take place?
I had a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in the Val-de-Calais for the following days: radios, reviews of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a sitting that does everything but we know that you can count on it, if need be, that we are not left to ourselves.
That is part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage-takers.
That was logical.
It did not embarrass me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages in Niger?
I listen to what is said.
The debate on ransom in particular.
Some things irritate me, others less.
I am trying to make a difference between questions about my past as hostages and my cascade of President of the World Food Organisation, which allows me to distance myself, and I think it is much more interesting to speak.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
In my view, there is a problem of semantics.
We need to call hostage hostage hostage taking - which is usually the case - and allow hostages to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in sympathy, in emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages.
But who is saying that these hostages may also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is doing this.
Why do we not say to the hostage-takers' you have flouted the rules of war, such as those of all the Geneva Conventions, you are going to bring you to justice? '
This, however, seems legitimate, legitimate and common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and that is shocking.
That is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the streets to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists is rising.
Two days before the trial of the defeated President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization across Egypt to call for the country's first democratically elected president to be re-established.
It is not a trial that underscores this Muslim Brotherhood militant.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the documents.
It is not a trial, it is a farce.
President Mohamed Morsi's trial is a fake trial, a pro-Morsi trial, he is supposed to judge Sisi, not the other way round.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres in Rabaa, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
There have been clashes in Alexandria, the police have used tear gas, 60 demonstrators have been arrested.
On Monday, 20 000 police officers will be deployed in the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel blames 9 US States for violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have a right to an identity card identity card and to the benefits that come with," recalled the minister in New York in a speech before Anti-Defamation League in the fight against anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to the same sex partners in the National Guard facilities," he has denounced, reproaching these states for violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defense said that he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Greass, to ensure that federal law was implemented.
The frontloading of nine states began with Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlement of the Sexual National Guard, owing to a conflict between the text of the text and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his rejection by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Caroline of South and West Virginia, according to a senior defense officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active people, 17 000 by including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skworkard on Saturday in Hyland
The sixth edition of the Play Skworkard takes place on Saturday 2 November at the Gate park in Hyland.
Together with the SK8 Unity of the Bump Association, competition should bring together the region's best skiers.
Interruptions are taking place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualification phases will start in the crowd, at 10 o'clock, before the final deadline for 3 p.m. and the award of the prices at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical achievements of young people who, for some, are already frequent competitions at the highest level, such as the young hydraulic prodigeese Lorenzo Plumbo.
Only 10 years ago he had already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen, and he does not like anything as long as he returns to competitors who exceed three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto hunting journalists who questioned him on a drugs issue
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drowning, according to several media.
A video handed over to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested party, Rob Ford, has always denied that he has used the ck, while recognizing that he has a pensioner for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled several journalists from his property.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected at a cat in the Val d'Oise
On Thursday 31 October, the authorities announced that a case of rabies had been detected at a chaton in the Val-de Oise, obviously of foreign origin, whereas France has been unscathed by indigenous cases since 2001.
The chaton was found on 25 October in Argmeneuil and died on 28 October.
Rrage diagnosis has been confirmed by the Pasker Institute.
"An epidemiological inquiry has been undertaken to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this chaton between 8 October and 28 October," says the ministries of health and agriculture.
'Five people who have been in contact with the chaton have already been identified 'and have received preventive treatment.
'Chance man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier, but before the symptoms arise, is very effective ', and the communiqué is clear.
The ministries now call on those who would have been dead, grieved, relayed, or lashed over a muquet or skin damaged by this chaton or whose animal would have been in contact with this chaton between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0811.00.00.95, between 10 a.m. and 18 hours from 1 November.
'France has been scared of rabies since 2001, this chaton or mother has been imported from another country, unscathed ', according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "indigenous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France officially declared itself unscathed in November 2001 by the International Office for Animal Health (OIE)."
A case of rabies on an illegally imported chip from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
'rabies is lethal disease if it is not treated in time ', recalls the ministries and is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease arise.
Obama's reform of the Health Equipment
During an avalanche of critics, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.
After hundreds of thousands of people have been given the resilience of their providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
He said in a speech in Boston that the vast majority of people with health insurance are entitled to it.
On the basis of what he calls a "surge in the current state of affairs," President Obama has encouraged the Americans to seek new market reassurance.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better adapted health systems for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
You will win the day, he said.
The administration has announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who are self-employed themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
Let me turn directly to those Americans: you deserve better, said Kathleen Seylius in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Mrs Sbelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, has indicated that the launch in October of the online market had failed miserably.
I am also frustrated and irritated by anyone else, but he has added.
I look forward to your confidence.
It was Kathleen Seylius exasperated who gave this sentence, when she believed her microphone, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's sitting following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, as to whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billary Long has consistently urged Mrs Sebelius why the architect of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthC.gov, which she now vines to millions of Americans.
Beeze a special camel at Abu Dhabi
The happy election, Jke Victe Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while incorporating the notions of speed and heat into the runway.
Germany's Sbastián Vettel, quadruple champion of Formula 1 world, has eased for free trials of Abu Dhabi's Grand Privacy Friday a special camel whose design was carried out by a Mexican fan of 21 years.
Vettel chose one of 1,500 desks sent from all over the world, in a competition launched by one of sponsors, a car brand, and a squirrel.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion, the pale, and his standoff closely.
Vetal had to carry this cake on Friday and Saturday, in trials.
It is likely that he will have another special camel on Sunday, for the race, to mark his fourth consecutive global title.
An Oubervian MP's Daily Party
Let us not deceive ourselves.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermine, its founder, the "suburbs Party" is not just about banners.
I have chosen a French card as a logo, justifying it.
When I speak of suburbs, I am addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his draft, presented on Thursday at the press conference in his home town of Aubervitilliers, was born out of the desire to defend multiculturalism better, this great cultural melting pot which is characterised above all by neighbourhoods.
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multiculturalism, which is indicated.
Abdel-Malik Djermine, 50 years of territorial attachment, is now claiming to be "100% apolitical" even though it has not always been neutral.
In 2002, together with Jean-Pierre Chevenment, he subsequently supported Dominique de Villepin's locally-based Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I am well aware that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left, but if right-wing people are prepared to support me, I will also listen to them.
There are only extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermine has built up his programme - consultable on Internet- from many themes that are supposed to speak to people in suburbs, especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, legalisation of cannabis, the civil majority at 16, the rehabilitation of the function of guardian of buildings...
It remains to be found candidates to form lists and to defend its ideas on the political stage. "For the 2014 municipal elections, it is likely to be fair," he recognizes.
It is a problem of time and money.
The suburbs Party should be represented in Aubervitilliers through my candidacy, and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djerba already has seven heads of list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the little support that I have received since yesterday does not come from all of the suburbs."
John Kerry admitted, unparalleled, that US espionage had gone too far in the wrong direction.
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the United States' defensive attitude towards his surveillance programmes by admitting, without precedent, that on several occasions, spying has gone too far in the wrong direction.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on automatic pilot, when a series of inflammatory revelations by whistleblowers Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came into being.
The leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an Intergovernmental Conference in London on video, Mr Kerry said: there is no denying that the President, myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things in an automatic pilot fashion because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course 11 September.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that American espionage had overrun, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said: in some cases, it went too far in the wrong way.
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now undergoing an in-depth review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations saved many lives.
He added: we live in a new world where people are ready to blow up.
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to blow them up and to attack governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have effectively prevented planes from falling, building blocks and people being murdered because we have been able to see the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the US, explained on Thursday the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken to Members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they made about the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organisations because of the sense of frustration that the surveillance of National Security Agency raises.
It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism, as Murphy, a democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the United States Senate's Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I am going to Europe to make them understand that we must continue working together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with certain allies of the United States, but the director of the agency said this week that this was not true and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metaphors that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations reported on Snowden's documents that NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and from 34 other heads of state.
The director of the intelligence services, James Clayer, justified the espionage of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this stormy atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office had a congress of Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be unveiled in the coming days.
He indicated that the route was still to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this journey was to improve relations, but also to show a great deal of firmness.
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been applying for years.
We can change our surveillance programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world who have to make espionage, said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Kerry has planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the ransom created by US strategies in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, overshadowed by Shell's poor performance and after the Fed announced its support for the economy as expected.
An Australian call for his prison sentence in Thailand.
A 21-year-old Sydney inhabited, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for allegedly having been attacked by a taxi driver, has appealed for judgment and has been released bail.
Steath Rochle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Court of Province on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver accompanied by two other men who controlled him had attacked him early on Sunday, 10 June.
However, video recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after she separated her small Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted that she had invented the history of all coins.
She was detained in a local local government unit before hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention center in Phuket's periphery rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of the former Australian League of rugby Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Foreign Ministry of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks declared Sydney Telegraph in Sydney that the entire family was extremely concerned about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her to return to Australia.
We have, of course, experienced an anguish moment, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible, declared Tunks.
Bamford appealed to the judgment and was released after a 50 000 baht was paid.
In Australia, the press said that, in the meantime, it was on holiday in the region of Krabi, southern Thailand.
Thai legal sources have indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agitation, Thailand could also seek to refine its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to a acquittal.
The French police will arrest the supporters of Andercht, who have come other than with the RSCA cartels.
The French police have decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against the Saint-Germant Paris, which was held on Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeeke, the Speaker of the Brussels-12 police area, on Friday.
The CSR supporters who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will necessarily have to use the RSCA travel system.
'The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former border post of Rekem to the PSG stage ', sent the spokesman.
The same will be true for return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has made it clear that action has been taken to arrest or even guard," as Marie Verbeeke has already announced.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeys school committee
In the Marguerite-Bourgeys school committee 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This was the reason, a year ago, for consultation with parents, pupils, teachers and members of the education staff, to reflect on how to better integrate pupils who live with the horse between several cultures.
The school committee has just unveiled its vision of 'Living together in French'.
The Vision Diversity organises a year in schools to help pupils from all origins to find common benchmarks that are not confined to the French language.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture and our places are benchmarks.
The great names of writers, artists, whether they are of a strain or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
'We are therefore creating projects so that they identify with all this', as the President of Vision Diversity, Aaida Kamar, explains.
Michel Venter, the Institute of New World, has identified several challenges for the school committee.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is culture quantum, the sense of belonging, support for staff in the transformations that we live in, in the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeys school committee has created a research centre which will provide tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azouz, the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation for a class in a North American context, quotations.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that is the real need," sum up.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, educational, social and cultural.
