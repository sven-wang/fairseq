Spectacultic in 'wingfollows' over Bogota
The sport Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the capital of Colombia.
Lquip√© of a wingfollows (a loving combination), he rose to 160 km / h over the famous Monserrate shrine, located at more than 3,000 metres of altitude, where a lot of badge gathered to watch his achievement.
A black box in your car?
While US road-network planners find it difficult to find the money to repair the decrepit motorway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box setting itself above your car's scoreboard.
The aircraft, all miles driven by a car driver and pass on the information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the major US roads.
The sector, which is generally irrelevant to the planning of major axes, has suddenly sparked heated debate and bumpy alliances.
The libertarians joined with environmentalists to press for the government to use small boxes to keep the mile you are travelling, and possibly of the route that you bypass, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is now in jail.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And, while Congressmen cannot agree to whether to continue, several states did not wait.
They are looking to see how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system which allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of drivers have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental vile.
This is absolutely essential for our nation.
This is not as if we had the choice of choice, said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of the Southern California Association of Cuters, according to which the state is beginning to record the miles travelled by each Californian car by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure stems from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans no longer buy as much petrol as they did before.
Cars can travel more than miles with one gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased over the last 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1%, while gasoline prices are high.
The gasoline tax is simply not tenable, said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently set up markers for 500 cars to test a system of pay to the mile.
In the long term, it appears to be the most logical alternative in the long term.
Wonks calls this use per mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea attracts tankers in cities, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in order to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California's planners are interested in the system as they design strategies for achieving the targets set out in ambitious state laws on global warming.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee, has said that he also considers it to be the most viable alternative in the long term.
Those in favour of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay.
It is not just a tax that runs into a great black hole, Adrian Moore, the deputy chairman of the policy of the Reason Foundation, Adrian Moore.
People are paying more for the benefits they have gained.
The movement is also supported by two former US transport secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move in the direction of paying for the mile.
The US Senate approved a 90-dollar project last year, which would have increased to about 10,000 cars.
But the House's presidency killed the proposal, responding to rural legislators "concern for voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or in the city.
Several states and cities, however, are making progress on their part.
The most determined is the Oregon, which has mobilised 5 000 drivers to conduct the country's largest experience.
These drivers will soon be paying for the state of mileage costs instead of petrol taxes.
The Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York envisages one.
Illinois are trying a trial on a limited number of lorries.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In the Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists have recently fitted their cars with a device, drivers were concerned that the government would be able to follow their shreds and gestures.
Alas, worries about Big Brother and these kinds of things are a big problem, said Alauddin Khan, who runs the strategic management of the performance of the Nevada Transport Department.
This is not something that people want.
From the very beginning of the trial, the ACLU of the Nevada warned on its website: it would be relatively easy to convert these devices into fully-fledged location devices.
There is no need to build an enormous and cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be enlarged to keep the recordings of the aisles and daily entries of the people.
The Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find an affordable technology that would enable the state to know how many miles a car can travel, but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do that, he added Khan, the people will be better off.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to rely on a small start-up company in California by the name of True Milin.
Originally, society did not want to help car users who pay tax to the Member States.
It sought to break into the emerging market of car insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the equipment that it tests has pleased the planners of the major routes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
It will make people more inclined to do this if you do not record their speed and do not localise them, said Ryan Morian, the chief executive of True Millen.
Large mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some states.
There are far cheaper ways and much less intrusive ways of doing things.
In Oregon, the planners are trying the experiment by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have an apparatus at all, preferring instead to pay a fork based on the average number of miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to mistrustful citizens by allowing appliances to do more, rather than enough.
In the city of New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system which would also be equipped to pay for the parking costs, provide a high level of insurance for driving and create a set of real-time speed speed data from drivers who car drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
It would encourage motorists to participate because of the advantages of the system being offered by them, has indicated a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole debate on the payment to be an identical one is not merely a huge distraction.
At the Commission's Metropolitan Transportation Area of the San Francisco Bay area, those in charge say that Congress could quite simply deal with the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing gasoline taxes.
An additional annual or single tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and other vehicles without a great deal of petrol, so that everyone pays their fair share.
It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin-boxing, said Randy Rentschler, the head of legislation and public affairs in the committee.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will be worried about protecting their privacy and a host of other things.
David Bowie: four new listening stories
The English musician has not come off guard this year.
From The Next Day, he concocted a luxury re-publication planned for 4 November, with several new ones.
Four have already emerged from the web.
David Bowie's announcement of the appearance of a new seaweed left the whole world to the limit.
On his 66th birthday, 8 January 2013, he said that a new album would be born in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates back to 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician demonstrated that he could still count on him to carve up the pop stage.
A Hope for its Foss
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one in his bag with The Next Day.
Thein White Duke, he said, to republish the album on 4 November.
On this occasion, he concocted a true feast for his fans.
The second edition, 'The Next Day Extra', will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, studio-studio sessions, and a DVD containing the four so-called 'devils'.
The Next Day Extra will, in total, contain ten additional titles in comparison with the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs made available on the occasion, as well as two mixed songs.
On the other hand, David Bowie has made presentations of this lovely safe box in a video.
It introduces not only the records, but also the accessories: all the photos and the exclusive pochbags, a clean bag to share one's own impressions, one booklet with the words...
And, above all, he gives a foretaste of his newfound Astuca title, typically in the mold of The Next Day, with very high dayings and well-mastered rock-power power.
The Unheard Unknown
But it is not the only reason to uncover his charms.
The Informing, and what is known as "Informed," is produced in the Web as well, Born In A UFO.
The Informing is double-faced: an alarming subway before a whingeing caves that gradually slow down and leaves a pop of pop.
On the subject of the likes of Mr Rocket Man, did he want to make a brief reference to Elton John's Rocket, and even to Gravity?
With this title, the singer at any rate seems to be in his favour when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again referred to his stranguess: would he come from another planet?
Guitarus, who are in trouble, want to leave the Earth.
Bowie, in any case, is amusing with these headlines: turn-by-person, man on board a rocket, the Martian potential...
It conceals and reveals, at one and the same time, that he is playing different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Starlov and Aladdin Sane.
It is no wonder that he therefore has a masquerading in the photograph of the 'Invitation' campaign, the Louis Vuitton brand, of which he represents the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, published from 10 November onwards.
The Defence Minister, Rob Nicholson, has insisted that the wounded soldiers are not being summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr Nicholson assured us that before their release, the army's members would follow a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All the wounded soldiers are given appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none of them is released until they are ready, he said.
Critics blame the government for wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not comply with the 'universality of service' of the army requiring staff to be able to perform a range of varied tasks - to reach the 10-year admissibility period required for retirement provision.
In particular, they mentioned two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including that of a soldier who was released last Friday.
The caporal David Hawkins, a reservisist of London, in Ontario, has been hit by post-traumatic stress disorder, has been released from the army despite his request to remain a year longer in order to be able to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case arose after that of caporal Glen, who said in a parliamentary committee last month that he had been forced to leave before he was ready because he did not comply with the universal service rule.
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared from the start, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them that I was not ready," he said in an interview with Le Press Canadiana on Wednesday.
For months, I asked whether there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the start of the major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to find out what scope it can give to the wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not fit to fight.
Under the current rules, the seriously injured soldiers are up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented in Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released on medical grounds, 199 did not reach the period of service required to obtain pension benefits.
The liberal spokesperson for ex-combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked on Wednesday for the return of Corporal Hawkins, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this disgraceful practice."
Disney on tablets to launch a lively series
The United States media and entertainment group has decided to favour tablet on their own television channels in order to set off a new set of children next time.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie' s Wild West will be available from 24 November on the website disneytuor.com or through its application for telephones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney chains is set to begin in 2014, which details the communiqu√© of its Disney Junior Division.
The cartoon, aimed at children aged 2-7, tells the adventure of the Callia, the sheriff of a West American town where it holds order with a weariness.
Every episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interaction with smart phones and tablets is a second nature for children now," said Albert Cheng, the deputy chairman of the digital products of Disney / ABC Television Group, mentioned in the communiqu√©.
This type of experience comes within the scope of Disney efforts to "expand the life of his series and build new relationships with its public through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of under-two years have already used a tablet or telephone, and 72% of the under-8s, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the question of American surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of US intelligence, said that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Str√∂bele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that Mr Snowden wrote to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said that, although the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to drop the criminal charges against him.
In connection with the complaint lodged by the United States Department of Justice, he is charged with spying and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, said in the Zeit Online: if Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German officials, we will make this happen.
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to the test after complaints that the NSA had tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Ophotn, the deputy in the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, indicated that if there was a chance of hearing Mr Snowden as a witness, without endangering and completely destroying relations with the United States.
Mr Str√∂bele, a German member of parliament, published a photograph with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Str√∂bele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultancy, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be given an assurance that he would be in the most safe way there, said the Member.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a serious and sustained campaign of persecution, which forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the worldwide reaction to the use of the instrument of political expression.
The citizens of the whole world, as well as the high-level officials, including those in the United States, have concluded that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent monitoring was of public use.
The letter presents an offer of cooperation with the German authorities when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.
Cogeco C√¢ble could soon offer interactive television.
Cogeco C√¢ble's subscribers may well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter, and ultiquietly a video-on-demand service via their television in what does not seem to be a distant future.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the betting version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to make more user-friendly interfaces and more options," the chairman and chief of the management of Cogeco, Louis Audet.
Cogeco C√¢ble is following in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary has no precise date as far as this new platform is concerned.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or to resist change, pointed out by Mr Audet.
The ultimate aim remains to provide tools that our customers currently do not have access to.
The telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if some technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the video-service is said to be in discussion with some major cable cables so that his service is available via their broadcasting platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco C√¢ble also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in its Fint address on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force satellite and cable television companies to offer customers the opportunity to pay services to the card.
"It is about two and a half years that we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of channels does not work ', said Mr Audet.
However, it hopes that the consultations carried out by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will result in some interesting recommendations.
'It must emerge from these discussions a new kind of reference framework for defining our new Canadian cultural policy on television ', said Cogeco's' Cogeco. '
The CRTC has been holding consultations with the public since last week and they should be continued with industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported to have made a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 by action.
This is a step backwards compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83% by action, over the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by means of amortization costs linked to new acquisitions.
Cogeco won the US-established cable cable, Atlantic Broadband, for 1.36 billion in 2012.
This was the first major acquisition of a company after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the authorities of Montenegro also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprise, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, amounting to 526 million.
As for Cogeco's income, they have grown by 41.5% in the fourth quarter in order to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco C√¢ble, was 43.9 million, or 90% by action, in comparison to the 45.7 million, or 93, by action, over the same period last year.
Cogeco C√¢ble's income, however, grew by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco C√¢ble customers is increasing 5546.
Mr Audet is not concerned about the number of customers floating in this way.
For me, it is not the indication of a change of trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the next with very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been found in beef-based product canned, sold by two small UK retailers of low-cost distribution, today announced the Food Hygiene Agency.
On-going tests have shown that the products, produced in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargans and Quality Save chains, contained only 1-5% of the DNA.
"Because horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product ', explained the UK agency.
At the beginning of the year, there was a scandal about the presence of horse-treated meat in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products which are supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people, earlier on Friday, on the 131 route, in Lanaudier.
Shortly before 4.00, a car driver travelling in the north, to Saint F√©lix-de-Valois, lost his vehicle and lost a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but their lives were not feared.
The traffic had returned to normal to 6h, Friday.
Frontier Airlines are considering paying cabin baggage
Frontier Airlines are considering charging up to 100 dollars for passengers transporting hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying $100 for hand baggage and $2 for a coffee or a soft, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that the passengers could carry a non-open bag with them to the descendant of the plane.
New hand luggage affects the bags in the top compartment, so the little bags under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers only once paid to the boarding gate.
Frontier's spokesman, Kate O' Malley has indicated that the $100 is meant to make people pay in advance.
We do not want to make this prize pay, she explained.
The airlines have started to make the first and second pieces of baggage paid in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs were putting as many things in them as they could with their handbags in the top compartments, and often there was no longer any place in these compartments.
These costs are a way of ensuring that passengers transport less things on board.
Oh Malley has said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money.
It is about getting the most faithful Frontier customers to understand that it is becoming more and more difficult to find space in the top compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's website will not have to pay.
In this way, a passenger queuing at a gas embarkate could carry a free bag, while the next person in the queue may have to pay $100 for a similar handbag.
O' Malley has explained that the Frontier-registration site and procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know about these costs before they reach the door.
Frontier baggage costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often make a fuss about luggage and other costs, but the airlines love them.
They are of the opinion that baggage handling costs are high and that the passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many in Wall Street see the addition of baggage as a sign that the airlines are paying enough to cover the cost of flying after years of loss.
Yet many of them have not been affected by baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first costs of hand luggage three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company requiring such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, has told the consultancy Jay Sorensen, which closely follows the extra costs.
He estimated, in a report in December 2011, that Spirit's handbaggage yielded $50 per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently traveled to Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the boarding gate at a time when passengers would discover the unusual hand baggage fees imposed by the airline.
I never had seen such a fluid embarkation procedure in my entire professional career, he said.
I had expected to see grinding headlights and quarrelling at the door.
The plane was full, he added, and the passenger was boarded at the speed of the flash.
Frontier is also like Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, sister or fruit juice.
Frontier has indicated that anyone who takes a soft or a fruit juice can carry with them, and those who take coffee can be free of charge.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways made a brief attempt to make the drinks pay in 2008, but then went back seven months later, after the passengers had complained and then no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to make luggage pay when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last-ditch effort to get customers to go to their website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $25 to $25 for every ticket that is sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of turning to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began to offer only half of the fidelity miles to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced miles of miles by 25% on a journey.
As a result, a Frontier-1 000-mile trip to an on-line travel agency would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their headquarters in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal customer in its home town, Denver, but its activity is receding and losing money.
The revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity fell by nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
It is an attempt to redress the finances of Frontier by selling the airline.
The NSA is calling into question an ongoing internal error, not of computer hackers, for the breakdown of his site.
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that caused his public site to run out for a few hours, not to hackers as some had claimed online.
NEW NSA.gov was unattainable for a few hours this evening because of an internal error that has taken place during a planned date of updating, indicated the spying agency in a declaration by email.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claims that the breakdown was due to an attack on the service distributed [SSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online-servers noted that the NSA's site had been at a standstill for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman indicated in ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not altogether at risk.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one online hacktiffs group claimed to be responsible for the NSA's breakdown by an SSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site breaks down.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated, and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the target system.
The once-secretive NSA, a time known as the "europno Internet Agency", has been in the spotlight and comes in for severe criticism in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs that are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by former United NSA consultancy contractor, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy about the agency has caused much speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville has now been closed down
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors to Montreal on Thursday after 36 years.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to the promoters who will convert it into student homes.
Three hundred and fifty people worked in the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees down.
Employers have come to meet employees directly and employees have been met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months' explains the regional director of the Hotel Delta, F√©lix Bisson.
Delta is closed in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was the owner of this building was a choice to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to make it, so there was investment of tens of millions at a time when competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
'Or he was selling it to someone else, and that is what happened, "Paul Arsenault, the owner of the Transspital tourism to the School of Sciences in the management of the UQAM.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the next few months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence place for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects with almost 600 chambers will come into being within two years.
According to Titan's CEO, "Goodyear's project for the purchase of Goodyear Amiens was launched '.
Having thrown the spate on the back in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site in Amiens-North, promised to close, Mauritius, the CEO of the American tyre Titan, is now declaring itself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1 137 in the factory.
Arnaud Monteburg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it, on Monday 21 October.
Having decided not to buy the factory in January, you are now returning.
You have made violent attacks and insults, referring to 'so-called' workers', who 'work three hours' by day, 'mad' trade unions, aiming at the CGT.
We do not understand this volte-face.
Is it to please Mr Monteburg?
I am not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr Monteburg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid jobs in industry.
If I have injured someone in my speech, I am sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth lie with you?
To work seven hours a day when in other countries people work eight hours is crippling France.
In India, China and other countries work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I am not prejudiced about France.
What I see is a factory that produces good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has room for enlargement.
Why did Titan need this factory so badly?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a decent price and competent workers, it is worth trying.
What type of agreement are you waiting for between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, after the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let us imagine that Titan buys the factory by Goodyear.
Titan could therefore move machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Monteburg knows that.
But he wants to keep the Amians plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agreed to recruit them among the approximately 1 200 employees at Goodyear.
Mr Monteburg therefore needs Titan's commitment before trying to bring the CGT to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear are concluding an agreement on severance allowances for all employees.
Therefore, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr Monteburg said you were prepared to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm this?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first reach agreement on the initial allowances.
If all employees accept them, the plant's shopping project is starting from zero.
How can we give guarantees of working time when there are no more employees at the site?
If Mr Monteburg manages to get the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan is buying the plant, it is our intention to remain in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombing fell, while aircraft deliveries and orders fell.
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aviation and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% fall in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a fall in orders and aircraft supplies in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains Division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has also failed to provide any test data for its new SerSeries aircraft or any information as to whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious schedule of commercial service marketing by next September.
After the inaugural flight from the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it only stole three times, and the question then arose as to whether the trial phase was well on its way.
The results fell far short of forecasts, and stock prices fell by 8% in the Toronto stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, has, on Thursday, reduced its credit rating from underperforming underperformance as a result of the low stock-market potential of the next quarter or two-quarters.
In the light of the fact that the drop in aircraft supplies was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division, said Cameron Doerksen in a note to the clients.
We believe that Bombardier will have new orders for its SerSeries as the flight test programme progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced over the next few months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the family of CSeries will be able to catapult it into the bottom of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and was first revealed in September after months of backwardness.
But the number of hard orders for the SerSeries aircraft so far has been modest to 177, and potential buyers seem to be waiting for the results of the flight tests in order to confirm the claims made by the company regarding energy efficiency and the potential for the new airliner aircraft.
At present, the company has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchasing commitments among 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, the president and leader of the leadership, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its objective of 300 firm orders prior to the commercial service of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was moving forward according to the timetable.
The test aircraft did not remain on the ground for longer than expected, said Mr Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the tests on the ground and the software updates were foreseen for the time taken by the plane.
Every manufacturer is planning in a different way.
We had decided to make a first flight and to have an update period, and that is what we have done.
This will happen throughout the flight programme.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the next few weeks, and the others will follow shortly afterwards.
Yet analysts are skeptical that the first customer will be able to fly CSeries only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was in the process of evaluating the calendar of entry into service and will provide further information in the coming months.
In the light of this slow and slow testing, although it is apparently in line with the internal calendar of Mumbai, reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed until the first quarter of 2015, Mr Doerksen said.
In the third quarter of September, Bombardier's net benefit fell to $147 M, or $8 per share, compared to $172, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The result of adjusted action has remained unchanged to 9 cents.
Income fell slightly from $4.2 to $4.1.
Analysts expected a 10-cent result in action and incomes of $4.56 m, Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth aviation manufacturer in the world has indicated that it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Agerautic division was 32.9 Md in 30 September, which was unchanged by 31 December of the previous year.
In Agerautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing, stated Mr Beaudoin.
The income of the Agerautics fell by 13% to $2 million.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, said that the income from this split had increased by nearly 11% to $2.1 million.
The bulk of the command of the transport division totalled $32.6 Md on September 30, a slight increase on 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the transport department have suffered implementation problems on a few large contracts.
The leaders have announced that further information will be provided in the fourth quarter.
The course of the Mumbai actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, the head of Google's Financial Board, would sit on the board, fell from 8.5% to USD 4.83 per Canadian in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazil's third-largest aviation manufacturer, Imbraer and the world's closest competitor, reported on a 10% drop in its quarterly earnings on Thursday.
Two spacks of 23 and 27 years had been missing in an abyss under Crolles since last Thursday, learned to the Iseerelief Speeers of the Is√®re.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one rotten to practice and the other, started under ground on Thursday at 9.30 p.m. in order to make a crossing from the Dent de Crolles, located on the St Pierre-de-Chartreuse municipality.
At that time, the same thing was said without further news.
"Doeologists should have been around 5.h in the morning," Thierry Larribe, a technical adviser to the relief-organisation Sp√©l√©o.
Dozens in Hope
Around twenty aid workers, ten civilians from the French rescue company, and police, police, and firemen were on the scene.
At the end of the afternoon, this Friday, the two siveologists were located.
"It is another group of spacks that, after having found them exhausted but in good health, sent the information to one of the network's aid teams" explains the Dauphine.
Both soldiers at the 13th battalion of the Chib√©ry Alpine Chassors have been found "exhausted, but not injured."
They have been lost in the network, they are back on their not waiting for help, they said pre-fecture.
They would have to come out of the cave with the aid of the aid workers in the evening.
German Journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German Journalists "Union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and UK intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo" search engines "from now on, she says, in a press release.
She considers the information provided by the Washington Post scandalous, according to which the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected vast amounts of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"Journalists" research is as confidential as the details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them, "said Michael Konken, chairman of the trade union who claims 38,000 members.
Fellow painted: one Member asks for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The draft by Minister Brigitte Grouwels of 'linking up' the traffic light at Brussels does not please everyone.
On a point of order, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport issued a test project at the centre of Brussels this Thursday to paint 16 traffic light bullets from the region on the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both to 'increase security' and 'the identity of Brussels'.
The idea is, in the long term, to paint all the traffic lights in Brussels, at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark," according to the Brussels Immanuel De Bock, who talks about the "flame-up" of the capital and calls for the 'resignation' of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend folklore money folklore on the road-peddling of the Brussels-based region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his operations as the capital of the Capitale," says De Bock in a press release.
After her yellow-yellow taxis, she finally re-painted the dark-light yellow yellow yellow knives in Brussels.
According to the honourable Member, there is now "no longer a difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels."
The Brussels laws deserve better than their money being wasted by a CD-V minister who carries out the NVA program itself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
'Just to remind you, Brigitte Grouwels was elected with only 2 245 votes, or 0.5% of Brusellaws! ', concludes Mr De Bock.
Pont-Buis' portion
The ecotax of Pont-de-Buis, which took place on Saturday in a violent demonstration by opponents of this tax, was demonstrated on Thursday morning.
There have been cranes in place soon after 10 a.m, and the movement on the national has been hijacked in the same breath.
The decision on decommissioning, announced by the Prefecture of Finist√®re on Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, a pork manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax portions in a state of operation in the department of the Finn, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching a by-product for Google Glass
An online store of multiple accessories to Google Glass has just been made available to the thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed glasses.
In this way they can acquire a retailer, a charger or a boredom.
This store, reserved only to developers already with Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and his widow USB, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a heatwave of protection made from microfibre or an intraaucular retailer.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass equipped with corrective vergences, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
It is already five years since my father faded from the world of the living.
At the beginning, I denied his death, I spoke to him now.
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I did not know how I was going to continue to be 'frequenting'.
There is no recipe, no form of employment, to pass through the wall of the invisible and to get on with it.
Then there were signs.
The first time was the very strong feeling that he was present on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Once again, a rude awakening in the middle of the night watching his watch, which no longer leaves me, at the night.
It is the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother has left us after her exhausting battle against cancer.
That, at least, is what I thought on the day when I found his bodies empty, racked up on this bed in a hospital in the cold praps.
Likewise, his funeral was a chilling farewell to the thin light of the candles that surrounded his coffin.
I thought she was part of it.
Slowly, by the small daytime or night-time appearances, a bit timid, a bit overwritten, she quickly returned to my mind, moving as she took its place into the landscape of my thought, which was in mourning.
And then she turned out, though, to reveal to me my own facets that I had not yet seen, masked by my relationship with it.
I therefore learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother, but simply a woman whom I did not know very much, a woman who embodied that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfect her life and liberated the person I liked, and now I found her full and full.
It is still the most unexpected and the finest way of going about it.
It is a privilege to know that the loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, 'inside and outside', he says.
It has always been said to me.
I never believed it then.
I have had difficult relations with him until he became old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day he is dead.
For a long time, he came with me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was badly...
He spoke to me, and encouraged me time and time again, that he lived my body.
I saw his hands by looking me, as I used to preside my body.
But it was never a non-starter.
I have had a personal life.
It left me with little sympathy.
It has lasted a long time, and one day he has left.
In the end, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged and advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten, they are invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I constantly feel close to me.
Every event, every moment in my life makes me feel that they are here, because I am always referring to them: what would they have said? What would they have thought?
I am constantly dreaming of them, perhaps not all of them, but several times a week is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, but there is always one thing that prevents me from doing that moment.
I am often anxious when it happens to me and I feel very strongly about them.
Sometimes, some dreams take me to the opposite and fall within my history, and indeed they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my echography, where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamt that I was awake to me, I was hoarding outside the bed, my father expected me to make a step and he would remember that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to say that he was happy to share what was happening to me.
And, of course, it was a little boy in my womb.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I am pleased to tell you this joint memory after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother was dying from cancer.
A year earlier, she was travelling with my family to Cuba.
It is the shock that his death caused to the young child that I was at the time.
In spite of everything, I have realised my sorrow very quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially at times when I am in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Appointing Arabic and taking an interest in the Middle East, to the extent of making it a master in a great school, were not, with the benefit of hindsight, been harmless choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where it had lived for decades - before regaining France when it came to independence.
The values that she has taught me are still present, so I sometimes think how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same applies to my attitudes: I am trying to live up to the generosity and rectitude of that which was a fervent supporter.
Now I feel it is a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a spirit of life.
I see his eyes as being on my mind.
My mother died 19 years ago now.
Morte after I spoke to me on the telephone.
I have gone through every stage: the incomprehension, anger, pain and the tears that are triggered only, whenever, in insolent places, incongruous times.
Then the time calmed the pain.
It has only remained the absence, this vacuum without a response, that this need to be entrusted to me, to reassure me of the dim of its gloom.
However, she is here, there silent, she is here and I am watching.
Every morning I see his eyes are worried about me, I see the brains that increase his eye, the half-heartedness of cigarettes, the bets that are at the top of the worries.
My mother took possession of my face and she is watching me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn a blind eye.
My wife and mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
There is a constant sense of protection, and nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, so we have gradually learned to smile and pronounce your name is no longer taboo, but rather a solace.
Of course, I speak to him in the night of the night when the absence is too bad, but in my dreams when morale is achieved.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the delay in time makes us realise how much it was masterminded by orchestras and we are trying to keep up the path that she has outlined to us.
If you had a very strong loved one, the absence could not take you away from heart and memory.
In some ways, being loved becomes your domestic energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him; I was always acting according to what he thought or what he liked.
I could not see his burial and three weeks after his death I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my own different convictions, I am still wondering whether my actions are in line with his view of things.
Indeed, I have had problems with these convictions in my work.
In my opinion, it is impossible to move in the opposite direction, I do not sleep on it and I am still wondering what he will think about it.
I do not know whether I have adopted the way he is or whether I am just as he is: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego; there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, it is a daily occurrence.
I feel she is here and I am pleased about it.
It is now thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son six years old.
The immense effort I have at my disposal has, of course, been reduced, but it is still close to me.
Very often he "landed" in my dreams so neatly, so vividly that in the wake of the awakening I am even sadder that it was only a dream.
On the other night he asked me whether I was going to get it right, I said no, he said to me 'I am out', but with such a real voice that I have woken up to the point, my anguish, and I turned on the hair and looked everywhere and convinced that he was coming.
I still live in the same House, and often I feel that I have been observed, and I am returning to see whether he is not here, I know he is and I am talking to him.
In any case, I feel that he is present, and I am pleased about it.
For nothing in the world, I would not leave the House where we have been happy and the spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone from his departure, and it is and will remain my life's love.
I would like to make it clear that I am a social person with a job of responsibility, I am, and I am moving, I am a grandmother, I am full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and never speak to him except my son, and I never go to the graveyard.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was in Iraq the most deadly month since April 2008.
This Friday Baghdad published official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This is happening on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants America to help.
"We are not saying to the world to be on our side and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki on Thursday in Washington.
And also because, if what happens in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will also spread.
And what happens when a terrorist virus is alive? It spreads itself.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Peace Institute, an independent institution set up by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They held up placards, accusing it, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide aid.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug godfather of a police investigation has been imprisoned.
Basharat Ditta, aged 42, gave the kingdom of the crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence by the Liverpool Home Court
A great defense lawyer, who had informed a drug godfather of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, aged 42, gave sensitive information to the crime-builder Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-trafficking activities after he compromise because of his habit of eating cocaine.
The attorney, who was called the 'second-rate' of the police and considered by the criminals, was arrested in 2011 following police eavesdropping operations in Scarborough, which he represented in a previous trial in connection with the drugs trade.
The police officials picked Sarborough, 32, putting forward three cocaine bags at the home of the lawyer in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while he was at a Bar dinner with colleagues.
Survey found Ditta to be a regular regular consumer of this A-class drug after tests showed traces of cocaine, on his portfolio and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought illicit information on the arrest of two men for Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into a heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after the police seized heroin and cocaine for the tune of ¬£1.5 million, as well as more than ¬£200 000 in cash in a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals, because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed in the light of day.
Now, at the Liverpool courtyard court, Ditta, who works in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, has fallen into disrepute after having been found guilty on two counts of impeding justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer came after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators have followed the suspect and noticed him when they arrived at the home of Ditta and who put drugs pure to 60% in the advocate's dustbin in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a Ewood Park dinner at Ewood Park, the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer has returned home, has discovered drugs and they have been telephoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular, regular consumer of cocaine after tests showed the traces of this class A-class drug, on its portfolio and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but denied cocaine; he said that he had been talking about the suspected drug trafficker because he was his client and said that their discussions were subject to a legal quantum privilege.
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all confiscated and he was taken out of a hair sample.
During an interrogation, he said that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that he arrived and that clients are calling him for legal questions.
But the court heard testimonies that he called major players in the drugs trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests, to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: if anyone has to know that you do not have to break the law, it is a lawyer who is a penalty.
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer and of getting too involved with individual clients.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own drug lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications, because it was his lawyer.
But it went well beyond the ordinary limits of the relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to carry on his criminal activities.
Mr Ditta did not honour his profession, but dishoned it.
It has moved too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he has allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal aground and said: 'If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited until 3 p.m., I would have done so immediately.
But, after the hearing, the superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta is a criminal barrister, once he began to get hold of drugs to criminal organizations.
His addiction to cocaine made it more difficult than ever and has made it vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the members of the organised criminal groups who had the job of obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the highest standards of integrity and create a climate of trust among the public.
Mr Ditta has betrayed that trust and has tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
The serious and organised crime unit of Lancashire carried out the investigation into Mr Ditta, who was found guilty of the three counts for cocaine and now an obstacle to justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals in the courts.
Let this be a warning to the criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and you will appear before the courts.
Scarborough was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in the trafficking of heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking have been condemned to a total of 153 years in drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta held a question-and-answer session on his website in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last guest guest, Muhammad Ali, and inequality would be the motivation to work.
Abera Franklin's Day in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of Mosul will be producing the Sound Board in the MotorCity Casino hotel on 21 December.
In November, Mrs Franklin was dealing with the registration of an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don and Kenny "Babydy."
Without specifying the disease she was suffering, the well-known language of respect told the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she received were "difficult."
She says it is' happy to be back '.
Merely reducing the cost of his Christmas illuminations
There are 420 grounds, 2.2 kilometers of sea-fishing that are covered with a light coat: one could shudder into the hot air in Menton with the illumination bill.
Factes which, unlike many local authorities, are also paid for by the taxpayers, not by the tradesmen 's associations.
In order to reduce its costs, the town uses leaps.
But also differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport had its shot removed after a shootings
A shootings at Los Angeles Airport took place.
It was 10.00 a.m. on the morning when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there are at least 2 injured.
It would be an employee working for the United States Transport Security Administration (TSA) and the perpetrator of shots.
The incident would have happened at terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
The travelers and staff went out of their way to the exits or tarmac.
Very quickly police forces have intervened and a man suspected of being the first owner was apprehended at the roof of an airport park.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
The Class Body
Each time, it is the school-based clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
All five people thought and interpreted by artists in the region, winegrowers with a great deal of humour, we are allowing teenagers to tame the classic song.
In addition to this spectacle, the lyrical art company of the United Kingdom will come back with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that is now full of the Puldeception of Utition.
Two more concerts will be held in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region a chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, there was support for this work called 'Apberlyrical', held last August, with the support of the soprano colrarano-Ebro Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it has helped the not-for-profit organism to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet as an air of the moonmouse.
Without giving any precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of yesterday's press meeting in Munitimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is taking shape even in the long term.
We have more solid and constant support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the fiftieth anniversary of the opt-out, a step that we will take in seven years', commented on the trustee.
'I would even say beyond ', added the Director-General, H√©l√®ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy de Surrey school faces six counts, according to Canada's Royal Gendarmerie.
Omar Mustapha Hassan has been accused of hijacking, kidnapping, threatening, wearing a weapon in a dangerous, kidnapping design, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the policemen involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the security of this incident," said the Corporal Bert Paquet.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New demand for collective redress against the Holy Cross
A new request for collective redress has been lodged against the Holy Cross, about sexual assaults that have been carried out this time by oratorical oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the plaintiff, identified as' J. J ', which would have been masked in the 1950 "s, first by our brother-in-Neiges by his teacher, brother Soumis, later by his colleague, Father Bernard, at the oratory oratorial, where he was serving as mass and where his father worked like a painter.
The first appeal was for only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us: "I was there, could I put it? ', tells the lawyer, Mr Arsenault, who is defending the victims in both cases.
The unusual feature of the collective redress that has just been tabled is to make it possible to add complainants from any establishment in which abuses could have been committed by members of the Holy Cross.
At present, the appeal meets the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been attacked by the Holy Cross.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first resort, since several of the establishments targeted closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also emphasises that the congregation of the Holy Cross and the St Joseph oratorium, which is a separate entity, 'have allowed sexual abuse to take place against children', that they 'had had a moral, religious and psychological compulsion on the victims, "that they" knew about the sexual abuse and suffocation of them, "and that they knowingly and knowingly chose to ignore the problem."
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Saint Cross lawyer, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, and also by the research carried out in the archives by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Saint Cross who publicly denounced the abuses.
Collective redress must first take the stage of admissibility in the upper court.
Once the Court has been admissible, the second step will be taken, in other words, the hearings on the substance.
In the case of the first resort, the congregation of Saint Cross-Cross had agreed to settle in an amicable manner before the hearings took place.
Hope in a Trade
A fire caused serious damage to a development in the LaSalle district in Montreal in the night of Thursday to Friday.
The aid was called to 1h, Friday, because of a fire that had said that an Indian kitchen was lying on the Dollard, near the intersection with the Janjane street.
The thirty-one fire-fighters who had been taken to the ground have taken almost an hour to control the fire.
The fire has "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," indicated the head of the Montreal safety service's operations, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in the restaurant when the firemen arrived on the scene.
There were no injured people, but nearly 20 homes, located at the first and second floors of this commercial brush, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested because the residents of one of the apartments could be temporarily housed, indicated the SIM.
Many Opposition to Medical Aid to die in Congress of palliative care
The Canadian Congress of palliative care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the medical aid law to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several organisations to provide palliative care to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all sufferers had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would like to end their days, according to a Canadian spokesperson for palliative care, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Qu√©bec palliative Network also rejects the plans for a medical aid law to die.
If he is adopted, Alberte D√©ry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of the palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of palliative Houses, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, a leading director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoy House in Gatisas says that the service would in any case be useless.
We never ask: 'I want to die, give me an injection'.
The head of the Ontaric Ehelative Relief Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Qu√©bec bill disorientates the population over the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that the Ontario will follow suit.
For its part, the Liberal Member of Gatisign, St√©phania Valleus, says that the concept of the end of life will have to be clarified before the draft law is adopted.
Kenya's media are unworthy of the controversial media law.
This is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from wiping out the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?, said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it, said Cyrus Kamau, the director-general of Capital Group's Capital Group, one of the radio stations and most respected independent news sites in Kenya.
He pointed out that the new media court will always be biased, because this is an extension of the government in question and that the restrictions on content and advertising would be detrimental to Kenya's position in the global economy.
I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this draft law and refer it back to the Members of Parliament in the field, he added.
According to the 'Star' newspaper, the new draft law will enable the government to get its hands on the media. For its part, the Standard has indicated that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have been dealt a hard blow and castigated the bill as "the" model.
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a package of measures to increase national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media have awakened the authorities "anger by broadcasting images of video-cameras on which the forces deployed on the stage of the attack were allegedly robbing the luxury business center.
The police chief, David Kimaiyo, has reacted by summoning two journalists and a media chief to question them, even though the invitation has been withdrawn following an outcry in the media.
Under the new draft law, the media will be able to be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being banned from the Internet or receiving official accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the assets of a offender if it has not paid its fine.
According to the Daily Nation, even one fine is enough to paralyze most of the FM-style stations.
He also says that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's' animal-style animblogosphere '.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do whatever they want with impunity.
No-one will ever be able to understand, wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in The Nation, describing Kenya's media as a key source of control in public life.
In the case of Livr√©s, the politicians would put the country out of business, and we would only go to hunting and gatherer.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of popular anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their fantastic salaries of around 532 000 shillings every month from the top of the world's top.
A Hard Year for Pharmacers
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Health and Social Services Centre (SSSC) in Laval caused a stir in the direction of the Cit√©-Health Hospital at the end of 2012-2013.
As a result of a large number of people retiring, maternity leave or departures, the pharmaceutical department has been running into a very large number of employees.
Almost 30% of the necessary staff was needed, making this financial year very difficult, according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the SSC has decided not to employ an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
The rotten has not been used, Mrs Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities have been rationalised or reduced by the time things were put in place.
We have, of course, worked very hard to get our young people into pharmacies, so that they can come here and stay here.
There is a combination of circumstances which meant that we were in a bad position last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, 2013-2014 will be much easier for the FSB's pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after their maternity leave, and three other pharmacists have been recruited in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have borne fruit, because the four pupils who were present at the time in Laval also decided to remain in the FSB's employment.
Now, much better, highlighted the pharmacist.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
It will therefore be necessary to catch up with us over the past year.
Growing Mastery
The situation is still a delicate one, however.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the preoccupation of young women, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to foresee.
For us, the number of employees is always precarious, because we have a medium that is young and employs a great many young women, in other words, with pregnancies, we almost always have three maternity leave when it goes well, has it added.
The last year was much more, and there are no pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old model does not begin its career in the cinema by the back door.
The director Lars von Trier has chosen him to be the incarnation of his next film, Charlotte Geneburg, in Nymphomaniac.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be in two parts (1 and 8 January 2014), the eroding memory of a four-year quadragenaire-based quadragenaire.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to his eldest is striking: a brown assault, a dyint diaphane, and French-British origins.
We must not forget that there is a certain risk: anyone who did not hesitate to put down on glossy paper will be displayed in much more sulomous situations on the big screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac set the temperature up on the Web: Stacy Martin is appearing on the bed and in the open with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative film-maker asked his players to placate their lukewarm, he had recourse to X-ray professionals for the most ossified sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; it is the star.
From Bj√∂rk to Charlotte Geneburg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier usually push her actresses into their late reins, always for the better.
Stacy Martin did not finish talking about her.
One of Narbon's CGR Chamber, which was evacuated on Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first sitting of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbon, as a precautionary measure, following the crowds of the throats of the viewers.
Immediately, the head of the establishment proceeded to evacuate the room and warned the fire-fighters for a suspect stench.
Approximately 70 people have left the sitting.
People have been examined and there is nothing given about full recognition of the Chamber.
Is it a bad joke on a limb-turn?
Or an involuntary incident?
However, the film leadership has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients at bottom.
The Chamber has been postponed and everything is now in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and customers were able to see the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
It is trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into cities.
Taking advantage of the Halloween Day, a woman tried to bring two kilos from cocaine to the country on Thursday morning at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was when the baggage was examined that drugs could be detected.
Cocaine had been distributed again in three cities that had previously been emptied.
The drug then went to Canada's Royal Gendarmerie Office (CCP), which took over from the investigation.
The Canada border services agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman was when she was intercepted.
This is part of the inquiry, and has indicated Jacqueline Roby, the spokesperson for FASFC.
What I can tell you is that it was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, the officials of the border services at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, of which 10 seized cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, the officials of the border services of the Quebec region made a total of 1653 drug seizures.
Said of Syria's military installations
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese air space on Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A short range of ground-to-air missiles by SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This latest raid on the aviation of the IDF in Syria (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances similar to that which took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who confirmed an Israeli attack on CNN, which this time targeted the Yakhai (ground missiles), delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their anger at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine's Wrong Approach
The credit rating agency Standard & Poor's has, on Friday, downgraded Ukraine's credit rating, casting doubt on the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's government debt is' B- ', which falls into the category of speculative investments.
With a negative perspective, S & P sees at least one in three opportunities that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is increasingly unlikely that the government's strategy will allow enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," says the US agency.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign-exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013, and says that the trend will continue.
This makes it difficult to reimburse foreign funds.
These reserves, which the authorities make use of on a massive scale in support of the local currency, the hryvnia, which has collapsed, the agency is increasingly finding a devaluation, thereby inflating its external debt.
In addition, Kiev needs cash to pay for its gas imports to Russia, which it accuses of not having paid a bill of USD 882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian leadership at a time of great tension with its Russian neighbour, angered by Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was published in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had been in the fifth quarter of the contraction from July to September.
Its still relatively modest debt has exploded in recent years, and S & P estimates it to 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has for months been calling for aid from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 gave it a $15.3 billion loan and has so far provided only EUR 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new slice until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, especially by increasing gas prices to the population.
After a new failed mission in the country, the IMF this week found that "important external financing needs" are "vulnerability," while "signs of economic improvement."
But, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, at the Center for Political Studies, "one cannot wait for any improvement in the short term."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year ', with the presidential elections due to be held in 2015, is the expert, questioned at the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international economic situation.
Moreover, S & P is linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is making conditional on the release of opposition opposition Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be good for trade in the long term, but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences associated with Russia's response," explained S & P, which fears "trade restrictions" by Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that, in the event of the creation of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should increase its border controls on imported goods.
America's Green Fast to the Pumic-Omnicom fusion
Pusincere and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the American authorities to their fusion, thus moving closer to the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
Indeed, the merger brings the world's second agency, Omnicom, and the third, with the fullness of time.
"Omnicom Group and Publipe Panel have announced today the expiry of the review deadline for the previously announced fusion of Puhi Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act of 1976, as amended," announced the two groups in a communiqu√©.
They say that they have also been granted the necessary authorisations to Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the HSR review period in the United States and the decisions on authorisation issued in the other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions needed to carry out the operation.
"Fusion is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese Army is hunting the M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would rob the M23 rebels to their bases in forests and the mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The 23 appear to be about to be beaten after being driven out of the localities of the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it has been controlling since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We are going to go ahead with the M23 and we will see it wherever he is, because he is a criminal," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesman of the FARDC.
We must not allow them to be reorganised because they have been a victim to the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to make peace.
Leaders of the 23 explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebellion leader, said in RFI that these military setbacks would not in any way alter their demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to the Ugandan ombudsmen, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the government in Kinshasa and M23.
There are hitches in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the latest site in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as to the surrounding areas of Runyoni, a hill in which the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of North Kivu province, profiting from the leak of government garage and the passive attitude of the blue helmets of Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of its workforce, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid rapid reaction brigade consisting of South African, Malawite and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC headquarters was overhauled, and the army went on the attack on the M23, making a change in the course of the war.
The rate of expansion of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The 23 appears to be coming to an end," says an expert on Congolese affairs, Jason Stearns, on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that the government of Kinshasa succeeded in fighting a major insurgency.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied to Rwanda has been present in the east of the DRC.
UN experts are accusing Rwanda, which denies it staunchly, of supporting the M23 militarily, which was originally made up of former Congolese soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, urged Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a Foreign Office spokesman.
Last week Kigali talked about the possibility of military reprisals following the shells in Rwanda.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana took to the streets of the city city in order to welcome the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We have lived a year with M23, and it seemed unimaginable to us to be liberated by the army one day, testifies to a living in this borderline town of Uganda.
"We lived in terror (23), we were traumatized," the man added.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus turned negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
So it says: 'The two cases identified in May 2013 remain, therefore, the only two confirmed cases in France to date'.
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached after being returned from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already claimed 50 lives.
Chevron, America's second-largest oil company, reported on a quarterly earnings cut on Friday, owing to the fall in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining in retreat from the group's targets.
Its net benefit in the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
The analysts surveyed by Reuters averaged on an action-by-action benefit of $2.71.
The group has produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up from the 2.52 million bpj bananas that were produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bnumber for this year, with growth of 25% of production expected by 2017.
The bulk of growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment spending has grown by $7 billion in two years and will reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Benefits from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter, while the profits of downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This fall in the refining margins affects the entire sector.
As Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported on a net benefit on Thursday, despite increasing gas and oil production.
Transfers of ecoconnection: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Commission of the Regions (Sherbrooke (SSRI) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year a fee of $150 per pupil (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for school pupils with two homes, a service that the organisation offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
'There is a mediation service proposed by the committee and I was interested, 'explains Mrs Lefotopoulos.
She said that the SSRI was invited to mediation and she asked for more time to consider it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult each other and to find solutions'.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke (SSRI) school-based Commission did not wish to comment.
The organisation merely meant that the mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio about the closure of the urgent urgencies of Hotel-God
In view of the fact that, for several months now, a number of staff and a number of trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister for Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to 'put off the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date for the closure of the urgencies which cannot take place on 4 November'.
An official request for 'to avoid any risk to the handling of urgencies in Paris early in the winter, "but also aimed not to obstruct the PPS campaign just a few months before the municipal authorities.
Despite the ministerial signs, the closure should still be effective at this time.
Even if, in the APHP, we prefer the term 'processing' or 'change in continuity'.
From 4 November, the firemen who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual journeys to the urgencies of the Hotsuch God will all be instructed to take the thirty serious cases a day to the urgencies of other Paris hospitals.
The date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the internails.
At the Hotel-God, emergency specialists will allow five internal general doctors to be established on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medical reading, it is programmed for the course of the month.
The 'Hottel-God' emergency service must close in the shortest possible time, and for us it is 4 November, "makes Lo√Øc Capron, the chairman of the EMEP Medical Commission (CME), who supports the project of leadership.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients led by the fire-fighters, only people who come from their own means, 'confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-God.
"But we will continue to receive patients as a matter of urgency," he tempers, arguing for the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on the ground in order to transfer serious cases.
Senior senior doctors will remain in the country, he assures.
But it is up to the LRA to decide to close down the emergency service.
"Things are gradually being done," says Nicolas Peju, the spokesman for the LRA who, on 4 November, 'there will be no change in terms of service'.
'The Minister lied to us or lies him ', deplores the emergency doctor G√©rald Kierzek.
Deposed from his position as head of the RUF in early July for leading the way against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "warning launcher" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure."
"They are in the process of emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he believes.
"If the other emergency services in Paris could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
However, they are regularly clogged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting for the Lariboisi√®re urgencies.
In the LRA, it is argued that thirty "dispatheated" patients at several sites are not in danger of representing an 'avalanche' in the other emergency services, the human resources of which will have been strengthened.
The 'new hospital model', which has already been set in motion since 7 October and which is expected to continue to provide 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the development of a 'continuous ambulatory care'.
"Where are we going to ask people to self-diagnose," says G√©rald Kierzek who says "the concept of a serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks "regression."
This will happen as in the case of Level 3 maternity hospitals.
People are not mad, they are going to go where there is the best supply of care.
If the Minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the Public Prosecutor's Office, warns Christopher Prudman, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We are going to be even more present as part of the municipal campaign, and we will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, an UMP councillor in Paris who was elected by the 4th plus district, clearly states that, "even if the Parisian UMP was for the continuation of the urgencies of the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we are returning to responsibilities'.
On Monday morning, Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist candidate, reiterated her call for a moratorium again on Monday morning, so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If it did, it would show up his net disagreement, emphasized Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of God's Hotel has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama's Global Monetary Fund / World Bank Election
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to its eavesdropping on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities, indicates an American chief, on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take over the footsteps of the NSA after the revelations by the former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that monitoring of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
When asked about it, an American administration official replied: "The US does not carry out electronic surveillance of the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Speaking under the cloak of anonymity, it did not say whether such monitoring had been carried out in the past.
Another official indicated that Barack Obama had ordered an end to these practices in recent weeks.
This instruction was given at roughly the same time as that ending the eavesdropping of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, on Thursday, the Senatorial Intelligence Commission approved increased controls on government supervisory programmes on Thursday, but allowed it to continue.
The committee has introduced further restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information.
The UN welcomes the new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now set to work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the long-term "sustainable development targets" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro.
They were in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to move beyond the prevailing national interests.
I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process of setting objectives for sustainable universal development (ODD), added.
These ODD will build on the progress made towards the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the MDGs.
At the same time, security concerns in Mozambique are growing, as are conflicts between powerful personalities.
On foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, tossing them, thousands of people gathered into the Maputo Centre to canker peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
We want peace to return; we want to see stability in the form of Vanessa de Sousa, the general head of an investment society.
Concerned for the future of her country, she has exchanged her working clothes against a 't-shirt' bearing the reference to the security of Portuguese citizens before it joined the crowd on the place of the capital's Independence on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports almost every day of conflict between government forces and the Renminbi, the biggest clashes since the peace agreement, which was signed more than 20 years ago.
In the past, the Renminbi was a famous rebel movement, originally supported by the Rhodesia led by whites and then South Africa's apartheid government in the effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into open conflict, but recent events have rocked foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes for the growing economy are enormous, because the discovery of enormous offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni d'Italy, and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party, and the main political force since 1975, and the Renminbi are blaming each other for the tensions.
The Renaissance says that the government was behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional bastion of the Rennumber, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of the Renminbi and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renminbi, according to the Financial Times.
The government is responsible for unleashing the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza said on Wednesday in the AFP, the French press agency, which Mr Dhlakama considered to be a losing force that wanted to use all the forces that he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government in question.
The Frelimo and the Renminbi insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew up after Mr Mazanga said that the Renminbi was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He said to the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer being complied with by Frelimo.
We want to resume the negotiations, but, with the greatest seriousness, Mr Mazanga indicated.
The previous discussions between the parties have failed to reduce the tensions caused by a series of conflicts this year.
Two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) have explained Joseph Hanlon, an emperor at Mozambique's open and specialist university.
None of them knows how to negotiate and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renminbi, which is in favour of electoral reform, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and a war chest by the government.
The share of the majority of the votes received by the Renminbi has been steadily declining since 1992, while a new party - the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MD) that was created by a former Renaissance member, is set to win more votes in the elections.
Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza, who is due to retire at the end of his second term next year, was hoping to destroy democracy in the country.
It does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency, Mr Mazanga.
It is not clear what the capacity of the Renaissance is, but it has carried out disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, especially Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after the Renminbi threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr Mazanga was riddled with timidity when he was asked whether this threat would be repeated by the Reninet.
The Renminbi wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, indicated Mr Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration that the government arouses, says Fernando Lima, the head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many of whom are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
It is the government and the president who are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is up to the President to find solutions to the problems that have arisen.
Omar Sultuane, a demonstrator, said that people only want stability.
No one cares about the Renminbi and Frelimo; they just want to see peace again, they want free access to the roads that they use, he said.
Children should be taught the myths and legends of children as being the equivalent of models of the style of life, says the author.
Thor's L√©gend might show that the force of brute force does not stand up against the whitewashed ruse, while the legend's legend reveals the importance of having a dream.
To say that many myths would be far too violent, far too scandalous and, in some cases, far too obscene to be taught at the school, Crossley-Holland has advocated a carefully applied selection of works adapted to age.
I think it is excellent that in America, myths and folklore are already part of the education system, he said.
I have been arguing in favour of this project for 20 years.
He went on to say that the fact that authors and teachers are openly didactic apply that the children who are involved do not have enough access to it, with the messages being of the highest calibre and in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Anglo-Saxon Beowres and wrote The Penguin Book of Norths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them away from you.
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or done away with, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; it must be revealed through a story rather than a declared one.
The known basis of what we are showing and what is not said.
An attack on Hamas's army branch was killed this evening and another wounded by an Israeli tank in the Gaza Strip, has been taught about medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a monitoring operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they received a barrage of shells from Israeli armored armour.
Spiking of the NSA: America's "went too far," says Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in his first row with Europe over the mass collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, disclosures, and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a US government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we are going to make sure it does not happen again ', said John Kerry at a conference in London in which he has participated from Washington on Thursday 31 October in a video connection.
In his broadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart, William Hague, the head of American diplomacy gave long-lasting justification to the intelligence and information-gathering practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Thinking about the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and the attack in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured us that the American authorities had, since the interception of communications and the collection of information, had had numerous terrorist projects.
"We have, in fact, prevented aircraft from falling, buildings are not exploding and people are being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects in advance ', argued the head of American diplomacy.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been misled."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases it went too far in the wrong way," the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak out on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
On Thursday evening, he assured us that President Obama was' determined to try to clarify and have a review of these practices so that no one felt they were being misled. "
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data by hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, which quotes documents from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, says that the programme called 'MUSCULAR', which is being conducted with the UK's counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the fibre opts used by the Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million elements had been collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails to parts of text or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices.
Over the last decade, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy have revealed that the NSA has intercepted mass-based data and communications from US allies and their leaders, notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
In response to the wrath of European states and at a time when leaks in the American press claimed that the American president was not aware of such eavesdropping, Barack Obama refused to speak out about it, invoking national security.
By contrast, the boss of the mighty NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency captured tens of millions of European citizens "communications.
He even threw the ball back on to the European intelligence services, which would have received these communications before they were sent to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where NATO allies are cooperating with the US, and it would not be aimed at Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And, on Friday of this week, the debate was spreading to Asia.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans in a vast network of international spying, which has also provoked Chinese anger.
The Saint-Germain will receive LOrient on Friday without its master master, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League of League 1 in a press release.
The PSG, the leader of the Monaco championship, at different purposes, has broadcast the list of players chosen for the 12th Day, with no sign of 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqu√© merely states that he is "injured," without specifying the nature of the wound.
But he was suffering from an inflammation of the left-wing party when he returned to the selection earlier this month.
A ceremony in Memory of the Farrmatized Defunts
The crematorium of Pachaise organises, at 11 a.m, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the defunct losses in his establishment, during the course of the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a Socialist candidate for the Paris Town Hall, will attend, and then, at a press conference, he will explain his proposals for a funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click on.
For their own funeral, an increasing number of French people are choosing the cremation, rather than the burial: 53%, according to a study published by the Ipsos carried out on 6 and 7 September instead of 47%.
For the burial of a close, the reverse is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In her book La Mort in ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and Vice-President of the National Ethics Committee of the funeral insists on the 'violence' of cremation for the survivors.
With the cremation, there is' violence against the loved body ', which will be' reduced to a lot of ash 'in a very short space of time, not after a process of decomposition, which "would be accompanied by the phases of the bereavement."
There is also 'symbolic violence', which is connected with the 'obliteration of special characteristics and the distinguishing signs' reduced to the 'anonymity' of the ashes.
Why is it that what is accepted without difficulty in some of the Nordic countries and Protestant countries, is it still not well known in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replies Marie-Fr√©d√©rique Bacqu√©, Chairman of the thanatology Society and author of the book Appray for death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to tame it.
Appressing cremation, it is for Fran√ßois Miatt-N√©rard, the chief executive of the funeral services of Paris's Ville, foresaw a ceremony as worthy of the funeral as he would have with burial.
The annual survey in Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one for their relatives, whether they are religious (53%), or civilian (24%).
Now 73% of the people who chose a cremation want a ceremony to be held.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Cretamata adapted to this development of society.
"For a decade or so, they have been trying to prevent the violence of the families from waiting for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ashes," is watching Mirules-Nero.
70% of the establishments now offer ceremonies, which carry out, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to bring it up to the others, to make sense of his death and to organise farewell.
This is the case with the crematorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
The ceremonies of ceremony are often people who have been converted.
There are also ancient Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Pachaise has, since 2010, been organising the day of La Toussung, several ceremonies of secular and non-religious remembrance, in which he calls on the families of those who have been claimed in the year.
For the second year running, one of these ceremonies is being broadcast to the attention of those who could not travel.
Crematorium authorised us to relay it.
In La Seyne, rehousing because of rats is becoming controversial.
At the beginning of the week, a family left its apartment from the Fruit Fructidor D2 building because of the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Office of the South Habitat, has proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, that the couple and three children should be located in a new T4.
Yet the family rejects' for financial reasons' and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, according to Jo√´l Canapa, the head of the office.
There have always been rats in cities.
The state-of-the-art approach makes two passages a year, and on top of that we intervene in every single request by the inhabitants.
We have thus made 64 speeches since the end of last winter.
The neighborhood is not left to drop, and the rats don't sink into the city.
For reasons of protecting the environment and public health, the products of rented media are four times less effective than in the past, but in two rats they are not going to kill a kid.
"We did not consign the rats to us," defended the father of the family who left his house to get to the hotel.
We are soon without a penny and we are waiting for a new home at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Stack fell by 0.88%.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday, despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The dollar has suffered as a result of the fall of the dollar against the yen, damaging to exporting values and warning of its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix yielded 11.23 (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell from more than 11% to 1,668.
A House of Burning in the Vives-Qu√©bec
A fire that broke out on Friday evening in the Vithey-Qu√©bec was quickly put in order.
More than thirty fire-fighters have been sent to 9 on the Hesbert street.
The flames have been found in a house of three houses spread across four shelves located behind the Seminaire Palaire's court.
All the tenants were absent from the fire.
The fire was contained an hour after the arrival of the fire-fighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first fire-fighters arrived, they really saw the smoke apparent.
"So the alarms were succeeded, because it took a surge to attack the building, because it was on the hills here, explained France Loiselle, the spokesperson for the Qu√©bec fire brigade.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the City of New York was the place where the stand-up arose in America: nearly 100 years ago, the vocal player Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremonial master in the Palace Theaway, on Broadway, began to tell the public about the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has been perpetuated over the years, to be resumed more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth birthday this year, with more than 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and great theatres.
Most of the posters emerged at the Caroins, and had great success until they became too famous to play in a popular club, said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to be able to continue to work with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, and the presentation of the most recent fighters, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, who will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of entertainment.
Several of the comedians at this year's festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, such as showing spectacles on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the scene in a sitcom on a cable station (the so-called League of Conduct on the subject of the infamous FXX football) and now has its own spectacle of sketchs on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate took part in the television programme on 'Director Night Live res', and was cast in the throats of the series of Internet Parks and Recreation, but it is more well known for its series of viral videos on the Shell Marcel the Shell with Shoes.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other comedian young men with a singular voice (the surrealistic pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice, W. Kaml Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of the American comedy.
One of the major factors in this year's festival will be an interview: David Steinberg, speaking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he led a TV programme on TV that was called the 'Down Comedy with David Steinberg'.
The meeting is taking place at the Hotel de Ville, in the centre of Manhattan.
The city is definitively in the comical DNA of all Larry-in-law, said Steinberg.
He told me that, when he was here, he sometimes came down in a rut between two buildings and said: well, if I lose my money, perhaps I will come here.
The Oil Price Stats Up, and it is close to $96 per barrel
The price of oil has continued to fall on Fridays at a time when concerns about the size of the stocks are offset by a report showing that the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China is growing stronger.
The price of US crude oil for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in Europe in e-commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down by 5.8% in October.
The plentiful supply of crude oil has been weighing on prices in recent weeks.
The US Energy Department indicated on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show a rise in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to recover after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter after a two-decade decline in the previous quarter.
Brent Brent, a benchmark for international crude oil already used by US refineries, has lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ECI) in London.
Avoiding the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Appeal Court restored to Texas some restrictions on the voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a first-instance judge this week.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in this state and broadly challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal's ruling means that doctors who practice IVG will have a "reception privilege" at local hospitals.
The right of admission is the right of a doctor, by virtue of his or her status as a hospital carer, to admit a patient in a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Supporters of the IVG argue that the content of the law might result in the immediate closure of one-third of the state's clinics, because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be around 22.000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a judge of first instance estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But Texas's Attorney General, the Republican Greg Abbott, who held the governor's post, asked the Court of Appeal to annul the first-instance judgment blocking the rule of law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a comeback in court, with 1.3 million viewers behind their television screens, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the spectacle in the making?
Some 10 000 candidates have appeared at the hearings for this 10th season, in order to confront the jury: Maurane, the Battle of Sinai, the perched Andr√© Manoukian and Olivier Netherlands.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite programs, many were disappointed.
But why so many disappointment?
There seems to be no candidate for this first premium.
As every year, the first issues of the hearing blend a wide range of yellow singers, for better and sometimes worse.
However, on Twitter, we want entertainment, emotion, originality and music...
Fortunately, some of them have found their way.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to the end.
Behind the television screens, the calls for successful songs are still here, season after season.
Others just want to laugh.
The court is blocking a decision on the NYPD's control and search policy.
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal blocked a decision by a judge demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search programme and drew it down.
The United States Court of Appeal (second circuit) has indicated that Judge Shieindlin's decision was suspended until the city appealed to them.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city has appealed against its findings and its corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department to change its policy and the associated training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the request for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge had to be drawn from the case because it violated the judges "code of conduct by undermining the need for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and Hispanic-born men as part of their program of control and search.
It has appointed an external controller to monitor the changes, in particular the reform of policies, training and supervision, and it has ordered the setting up of a pilot programme to test body cameras in areas where the greatest number of controls are carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of those whose cases are rejected after police checks.
The appeal hearing by the town is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of control and the search has been criticised by many defenders of civil rights.
This system of control and search has been in place for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls rose dramatically under the administration of the independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls, mainly of black men and Hispanic sources.
In 2004, legal action was introduced by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Those who advocate changes in the NYPD control and crowd program say that they will end unfair practices, make police forces more effective and trusted, and will be able to change the way in which police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, representing a waste of money and not solving the wider problem of pressure police after police officers have been cut sharply over the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to control and search practices, which are constitutional, but that it reforged the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must vote, because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes on the city.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each housing.
We are obliged to increase rents in order to help us pay the new taxes.
By going through the vote, we are sending a clear message.
We need to make a change to the Ville.
All the candidates have told us that they will tackle scandalous debt.
We can no longer afford to pay $100, 000 fireworks, from $4 million to $5 million in case...
Go and vote, that is the best way to express yourself and to say that it is enough.
Elys√©e's Lack of Service of the Elys√©e Palace
When kicked in the 500 m2 kitchen kitchens committed after working in embassies, the cook has climbed down the ladder until he became leader nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran√ßois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including their holiday destinations, and added countless large numbers of this world into a virtual anonymity that he is now breaking, by the time of retirement, to 60 years.
The man with an open face, with cronies and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferty-Saint-Aubin, is the holder of a pastritic CAP.
His mother was a cooks herself in a castle of Snorthern.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!" ironise Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the foibles of the six Presidents for whom he has served, but also their wives and some of their distinguished guests.
"It is always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he reminds us.
"Mrs Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight to the kitchen, to the point that she had banned women in the Elys√©e kitchen!
With all due respect to the Heads of State who were somewhat indifferent to the use of terrestrial foods, "they are all greedy," says Bernard Vaussion.
Indeed, Jacques Chirac had "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had done away with the cheese, the bases went empty!
As for Fran√ßois Hollande, who has re-established cheese, 'he is a person who likes to eat' and 'there is not much he does not like'.
The current head of state, who returned the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime."
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially at the State dinners in the Elys√©e Palace: "Between 200 and 250 people must be served in an hour or so.
The night is almost white.
These people would not understand if there were errors.
The now ex-head of the Elys√©e kitchens, who made a glass on Tuesday evening with his team, family, and friends, starts with a pinch in my heart. "Fran√ßois Hollande has come to welcome me."
He said some praise.
"His human side came out," he said.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been in power for seventeen years in the Elys√©e Palace.
Hope in a House built in 1850 in Qu√©bec
An historic house built in 1850 was consumed by the flames in the Vives-Qu√©bec on Friday lunchtime.
The building of four homes, in the 15th of Hebert Street, was the subject of three alarms for the fire service.
The fire was on the front page, but stood on the three-floor of the building.
France Voiselle, the spokesperson for the Qu√©bec Fire Protection Service, said that rapid action by the fire-fighters has made it possible to prevent the spread of flames in adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector in the town where the buildings are constructed close.
The house was burned to housing four homes, but none of them was on the ground when the fire took place.
The damage was, after all, limited, even though the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out to ascertain where the cause came from, but the trainers have dismissed the theory of a criminal act.
Wall Street's Launch: Exiting the Second
Martin Scorsese is missing some images of his next film, whose role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is exemplified by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and come out of your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio will set you aside in his role of trader already.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Exchange," which refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a big story of corruption on Wall Street.
In the 1980 "s, Jordan's is a scam that will make him rich, rich, and rich.
The opportunity to follow his incredible rise, but also the staggering fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man takes the festive, the women, the drugs.
Deadence and excesses of all kinds are the key words of this mad history.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The way out of the new Scorsese was delayed because it was too long-winded.
It seems that the film finally lasts 245.
When he is in the Chamber on 25 December, he will be able to take part in the race for the Oscars by the skin.
Coulson used telephone hacking to check a knife
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used telephone hacking, monitoring, and confrontation in an attempt to confirm a phoney line on a link involving the current Interior Minister, Charles Clarke.
The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his special-drug adviser.
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detector, to hack Pawlby's tin box and to keep on trying at its door, but Coulson called it, and gave it voice messages.
The charge suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay at the house in the hope of the surprise, is the kind of man who likes to present the story to people to see what they say about it, said Mr Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate issues: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is clear that he is aware of the second, monitoring, and it cannot be any other way.
But what about the first?
Is he aware of telephone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we do, of course, say that if you do not take it.
The rumors of a connection involving Clarke were taken up first by the NotW drafting office when a source, having a sexual appeal to Miss Pawlby, said that it had been said to him: 'Don't waste your time with her', she is with Charles.
A band, on which voice messages to pirate pirate on his telephone at least three times, was seized at the Mulcaire's house in August 2006.
Investigators have also found computer seizures from the private detective detector, which involved Miss Pawlby and his sister in a case called 'Direct-proof'.
During the period in which the detective detected her, the grandparents of Miss Pawlby received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about it, added Mr Edis.
In the meantime, the former reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter, James Weatherup, have overseen the surveillance of the smallest facts and gestures of Miss Pawlby.
In a vocal message he gave him on 18 June 2005, he said: 'I have a story which we plan to publish tomorrow, which I would really like to talk about in Charles.
Mr Edis said that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had to deal with Mr Blunkett about a link to a married woman when he was in the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny that they have conspired to pirate telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out telephone hacking.
Barack Obama Lakes Iraq's Prime Minister, in the midst of a spike in violence
The American president was due to receive Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki on Friday 1 November 2013, seeking support from the United States to combat the biggest wave of violence over the past five years.
Iraq had its most deadly month in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday 1 November.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1 600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher balance to 979 dead and 1 902 injured.
This violence has become increasingly lethal, despite enhanced security measures and large-scale military operations launched months ago by Nouri al-Maliki's government, dominated by the Shia.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1 073 people were killed.
Two years on from the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence has caused the prospect of another conflagration, while neighbouring Syria is in the grip of civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funeral.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains to be politically marginalized and to be the target of unjust arrests, has encouraged this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Iraq.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and to the Levant (ESIS), a group affiliated with al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in Syria's civil war.
Nouri al-Maliki wants a "global war" against al-Qaeda.
Violence is at the center of talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12.
At the time, the American president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since he arrived in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri al-Maliki has had several rounds of meetings with the executive and congressional officials.
On Thursday he called for the international community to wage a "Third World War" against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security aid to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and democratic senators.
But the US has also criticized Nouri al-Maliki, a Shia, who gave him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian politics."
They also demanded that Barack Obama make clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "Iran's pernicious influence in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing's Uighur Group of the Tiananmen Square attack
On Friday, the Chinese Head of Homeland Security accused a group of Uyghur separatists of Xinjiang for behind the bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square on Monday in Beijing.
The vehicle, a SUV, jumped into the crowd that was on the famous square of the Chinese capital, the symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and set fire to its three passengers and two passers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, has accused the East Turkestan Islamic movement of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uyghurs, a Turkish-speaking minority living in Xinjiang, call this Chinese Eastern Turkestan province.
For China's government, the movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that are rife with independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organised and premeditated," Meng said to the Hong-kongaise Phoenix TV station.
"The behind-the-scenes group was the Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan," he added, "his words being taken up by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he was of Uyghurs and said that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
It also contained tanks full of petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident resulted in 42 people being injured.
The Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan is regarded as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican of contraception, Divorces and Homosexuals
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large-scale survey around the world on how the parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce, and same-sex couples.
The survey asks the participants how the priests look after the couples and their children, and how they treat the men and women who live together without being united by the marriage.
The poll was sent in mid-October to every national conference of bishops, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important rally on the family that Pope Francis plans to organise next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the 'National Catholic Reporter', an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesperson for the Catholic Bishops Conference in the United States confirmed that the document was genuine and that every bishop would decide in the appropriate way to sound out the parish.
In the UK, bishops have published an Internet poll asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The Army attacks the last rebel fiefdom
The deductibles of the M23, or a few hundred, fighters, were tranigned at nearly 2,000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located at about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It has not stopped since this morning, the fighting is continuing despite the night and indicated to the AFP one from Jomba, joined by telephone to 12.30, according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased somewhat," he added, "it seems that the DRC's Armed Forces have rejected the rebels a little. '
According to the witness to anonymity, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before they climbed into the front for a "ration operation."
There was a great deal of talk behind him about the pittance of small arms.
From Bunagana, a political fiefdom and the last strong rebellion that took place on Wednesday, an AFP journalist was able to hear heavy-arms detonations.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilical Stabilization Mission, the fighting has entered "in the final phase," with the FARDC "crowding residual" positions.
Since the resumption, on Friday, of the clashes between the Movement of 23 Mars (M23) and the army, Monusco is not directly involved in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support for intelligence, observation and planning.
By the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, showed leadership on the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, the border post with Uganda, civilian-assisted military personnel carried out a multiple-brush rocket on a nine-speed HARDC lorry, which had to cope with another machine piloting the 23 positions on the hills of M23.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels again on Wednesday evening to 'voluntarily demolish themselves' on pain of being disarmed 'by force', but has left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and 23 have been discussing since December without any result at the moment.
On the spot, M23's political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We ended the talks, only the Ugandan mediation to organise the signing, Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately by the government side.
The 23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of ex-rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which is refuting Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where around 5000 people arrived between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the return movement to the DRC that took place in the morning turned out to be reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went through our fields, but the military told us to withdraw ', said to the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, one of whom was on the back.
The impression is that shots are moving closer to the people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of inhabitants crossed the border, some with a mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The Musical Body, the Leadership Show
Classified, sophisticated, popular, English or French productions are taking off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the musical to the French is said to be a kind of success.
For a long time, from our Paris Lady to Mozart the opera opera, most attempts were made to make fools of themselves.
And the successes, such as Cabaret and the Missile, have wrought the halo of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Ch√¢telet and Stage-receptive Entertainment in Mogador has changed the situation.
Now these two scenes are eating headlines like successful tubes.
The first, this Christmas, is an excellent My Fair Fair and announces that it will be the global creation of an American in Paris.
In Mogador, 'La Belle and Bar' may well be one of the successes of the season.
On other scenes, musical spectacles like "1789," "the aments of the Bastille" and small musical comedy comedy like "Disco" or "Life and Times" are calming up their success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the book of musical comedy and lecturing in the theatre of Ch√¢telet, an analysis of the reasons for such hard-won success.
How do you develop French musical comedy?
The supply has multiplied.
First of all, there are the 'musical spectacles' that develop as producers...
There are some who make use of images of images and a true history of the size of 1789, the Agrts of the Bastille.
Others are taking a step backwards by 15 years, on the grounds that it is possible to use almost as much as any other when we have Matt-style Pokora in the poster.
After that, musical comedy comedy comedians in Ch√¢telet are returning to us the golden age of Broadway and find out the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage-receptipopularpopularise of Anglo-Saxon musical comedy comedy by adapting them to French.
The independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent," "Women's Baising," or "The Spring Awakening" have difficulty in being financed.
Do we have enough artists like Broadway de songer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight music shows in a season, it is a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who are working on projects for projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy is very different.
Young people are trained in these jobs in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, dayings, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of jobs to be filled.
Why are the boreholes in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor relation of culture in France.
Very few pieces of theatre are departing, and it is often the result of the use of boulevards for adults and not for young adults.
Musicians' spectacles make up this very thing.
These are the same young people who love reality and what it produces as fleeting...
Proposing beautiful young men (often gifted) as the poster of a musical spectacle, is an assurance that they will be gripped by these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are skilfully eclipsed by professionals who answer questions.
These spectacles are expected when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The chaos in Paris has risen to Paris and is consumed by the provincial authorities.
The show is designed to enter all of France's major cinemas in the same form as in Paris.
A Serious Launch in an accident with a phantom driver in Brussels.
A road accident caused one serious injury, on Friday morning to 5.30, at the Brussels internal ring to Hoeilaart, to Waterloo.
The car of a conductor was lost by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9 a.m, to 9 a.m, the time taken by the road to be cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this has not led to any traffic congestion, because the accident happened in the wake of the Hoeilaart exit.
As a result, traffic has been diverted away from this exit / entrance from the ring.
A Hidly Smog in a Transneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed, but he is still in hospital.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a gray boat called Pirates of the Caribbean.
It has been closed off until further notice.
DRC: the Army is preparing a new assault
Children are playing on a carbon shield that belonged to the M23 rebels, in Kibumba, on 31 October 2013, in the east of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing, on Friday, a new assault on the last bastions of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in the east of the DRC.
The aim is to remove the 23 of the hills above Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina's hill, which oversteps that of Mbuzi.
Now, Mawzi is expected to fall by itself.
There will be only Runyonyi's hill.
"Chanzu is not very strategic," said the AFP the Governor of North Kivu, Julian Paluku.
Mr Paluku plans to visit Saturday a Bunagana.
Political and last-rate leader of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, approximately 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, several hundred diehons of the M23 have been tranigned at nearly 2,000 000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and nearby town in Jomba.
In Jomba, an inhabitant who had reported on the fighting close to Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation had been 'calm since this morning'.
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and were buried.
A girl was injured by the bullet, and three others were injured, including one charge, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness by the AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between the FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two warring parties have failed to produce a human loss of life.
The NSA's revelations increase the paranoia of corporations with regard to state surveillance
With a nice day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew at the low altitude of the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the behest of the Federal Constitutional Office (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than five kilometres from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BfV was hoping to identify the presence of eavesdropping offices and that the operation led to an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
On September, US intelligence chief James Clapper emphasized in September that the US is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to crack down on foreign companies "industrial secrets for US companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But, since Edward Snowden, the turned-out consultant, has begun to uncover its inexhaustible wealth of information about the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to believe the chief executive.
Reports, according to which the US National Security Agency has sped on Brazil's oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in the Cloud, notably Google and Yahoo, have more than ever led to paranoia by companies with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone was pirated, perhaps for a decade, was the straw that broke the camel's back.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses more transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data should be used for their mutual benefit.
Germany must wake up, says Oliver Gr√ºn, BITMi president, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the US poses as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an inquiry published in July by the board of board EY.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has sent industrial secrets from companies outside the United States.
The politicians have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capacity and believes that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Entrepreneurs are skeptical about this.
One Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
This is not the right way to go about it, as Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry is not.
But the breadth and sophistication of US spying agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations were a shock to some firms that had previously believed that China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud science, as European officials have become aware that the data retained in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and, therefore, potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, some 10% of non-American members have renounced their plans to use an American storage service provider in the US after the revelations about the American Prison data exploration programme.
Jim Snabe, the co-director of SAP, says: 'If our customers are here today, we have a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where my data is retained and can you assure me that they will remain physically in that jurisdiction?
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic spying.
There have always been.
This has been a recurrent theme for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current debate on the subject, says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the chemical-producing company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us in business and industry just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Entrepreneurs are usually reluctant to reveal the preventive measures that they have put in place, should this lead to an adversary's advantage.
Big business has long had the message that it is, to say the least, imprudent to recover a free flash key in a professional room or to leave a computer with no surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the car manufacturer Audi, says that the collection of mobile phones before the meetings of the Council, so that they cannot be used as distance tapping equipment, has been a practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using mere mobile phones that are pre-paid when they travel abroad because of the danger to the integrity of smart phones.
Pre-paid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorised access to the Internet, warns the BfV in a report.
The United States are alerting their own companies to the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which was carried out by the United States in February, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, which are guilty of carrying out economic intelligence piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
One member of the board of a renowned German company thought that when it comes to industrial espionage, the French are the worst-off.
Bernard Squarcini, a former director of French domestic intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Let us have the services fully aware that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered.
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose bodies have been caught up in a fight rode in his school gymnasis, believe that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11, when he was caught up in a treacherous carpet behind the parish grade of his high school.
The sheriff investigators of Lowndes of Lowndes concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy's family challenges these findings.
They are absolutely certain that their son was assassinated, said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought that he was dead in the manner indicated in sheriff's conclusions.
By contrast, they think it beggars belief, the laws of physics and the common sense of the word, has added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered with the sole aim of covering the person responsible for the death of their son.
They sent their sons to school with a schoolbag and they have been given it in a quaint bag, he added.
US Chief Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was carrying out an official investigation into Johnson's death, pointing out that a number of important issues remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I am going to follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My aim is to discover the truth.
In the light of this, I consider that there is a sufficient basis for an official investigation, he said.
Moore said to journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died by means of a second-hand wholesale system.
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
A number of questions still need to be answered or confirmed by the Commission.
Moore added that if he uncovered evidence to justify a civil or criminal inquiry into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to carry it.
The representative of the sheriff office in Lowndes was not available to give his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A southern Georgian judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video-recording recordings that the investigators had examined.
The parents of the teenager said that they expected the video footage to contain evidence of the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishes expert advice on allergies in children at school.
On Wednesday, the American Centre for Disease Control published a series of directives on how to deal with children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the US Government publishes, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has increased dramatically.
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information to schools on how to raise awareness of the orally-spoken body and the food allergy in children, and on how to deal with them when there is an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a epic epic stock, which is the most commonly used EpiPen's car, so that they can react quickly in the event of a life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of the Member States have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have a sword sword.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms given by children who have an allergic reaction.
The children can say, and I am under the impression that something is getting through to me, namely that the language used by the Member States is not the same.
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate about intelligence.
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French Government, which, on the one hand, offends in public by summoning the United States ambassador on 21 October, while on the other banning the overflying of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of Edward Snowden's presence on his board?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When Fran√ßois Hollande telephone to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius dismissed the US ambassador, they react to a true discovery, which is the scale of American surveillance of all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde just a few weeks before the US diplomatic correspondence was repeated and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the accounts of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Would it not be a hypocritical wave on your part?
Journalistic conduct is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks draws a veil over the analysis by American diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we see this as an important light, given American power.
When we describe America's interception of intelligence against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to our shame that this is what the world stands for.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The implementation, over the last ten years, of highly powerful monitoring technology by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, France and the United States, in particular, have established procedures for cooperation and for the exchange of information, almost daily, which are described on both sides as being essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the resources of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services and, in return - as has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French about other parts of the world.
Therefore, the fundamental issue behind this NSA affair is not so much the ability or right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, the question of the total lack of prior debate, particularly in the parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of attacks on freedoms.
What is the real danger to the US?
It is all very well to denounce them, but I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk to the Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this was the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest levels of their state, have been monitored.
This is true of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have strained.
Another effect may be more economic: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to hand over their confidential data to American service providers subject to American laws, and thus to the grip of the NSA.
Last but not least, the vast wave of revelations by media around the world, which is helping to set in motion a debate on the monitoring practices of the previously virtually non-existent intelligence services, could lead legislators, including American ones, to reconsider the powers that they have given to their intelligence services.
The parents of intergender children may choose to use the non-determined sex that they use.
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third sex for babies born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborn born will no longer be attributed to their birth in a rigid way.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be obliged to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to include a bidentified, non-specified gender on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on parents who could make hasty decisions about a sexual reassignment surgery, and to combat discrimination against intergender people.
According to the BBC, an intergender person would have said years later, and I am neither a man nor a woman, but rather I am not a man or a woman.
I will be left with the patchwork that has been created by doctors, commissioned and put on fire.
It is estimated that a child born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intergender, intersexuality being part of the group of sixty-three of the diseases diagnosed as the disorder of sexual development, a generic term describing people with chromosomes or atypical ovaries (ovaries or testicular) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intergender.
Sexual identification is still not properly understood, but most specialists in the United States say that where gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to allocate it, and then to wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and an expert on sexual identification, said that the new German law is a good idea.
Inter-gender children pose an ethical dilemma.
Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases, which require a surgical act, but this is not the case for most of the children who are under the sun, he added.
It is possible to make sexual assigning without operation, and to see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very accurate.
Nobody can answer the question as to why this is happening.
It is like the mystery about homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intergender people as different from transsexuals or transgender people, since their status is not linked to gender but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or a woman alone, but is usually both at once and not clearly defined as being one or the other.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters - such as muscle mass, pint, poitcases, and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by persons who are intergender and transgender in employment, as well as the scale of the acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young, non-compliant boys now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to classify male, female, or third-sex sex on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognised as a neutral third party after they won his appeal, which allowed him to retain a non-specified, non-specified gender.
German passports will consist of a third designation alongside M or F-based 'intergender', according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always the object of controversy, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition calling for the theory of gender theory to be removed from school books.
The American website, Catholic Online, has also opposed German law, saying that if the world is dragged into a new rule where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilisation are being handed over.
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said in Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to babies at birth.
The parent's role is sufficiently stressed without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child, she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodite, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god, which had a double sex.
And, barely a decade ago, the medical community considered gender to be an ardor, which can be erased and redesigned.
But now many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can make mistakes, not knowing how a child will experience his sexual release when he grows up.
In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a "psychiatric emergency" - Drescher.
When these children were born, the psychiatrist was not mentioned, the surgeon was telephoned.
The prevailing theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr John Money from the Johns-Hopkins University, which considered gender to be malleable.
He devoted the term 'sexual identity' and argued that the social and environmental signals of parents raising a child are interacting with the genes and hormones of a child in order to identify them as male or female.
But, in a 1966 case, which is known as the bidder John-Joan, his theories gave rise to controversy.
He advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been turned off by a sloppy circumcision to have him castigated in his entirety, by also raising his boss and raising him like a girl.
MisMoney presented this as a successful transitional case, but it was not the case that Drescher said.
By the age of some 15 years, he became a boy and married to a woman.
But, at age 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors always copy this model.
But in the 1990 "s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these gender-change operations say that they are not satisfied with the result.
Such is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with chromosoms XY but was made up of ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say whether he had a large oritoris or a pense and were convinced that he could never have a satisfactory, decent lifestyle.
So, shortly after he was born in 1976, Bruce was subjected to a surgical ablation of the external body and the testicular and was elevated like a daughter.
She was given female hormone at the age of 12.
Well, I knew that I was not a daughter-fighter, he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
Eighteen years on, he has had a plasma mill.
But it was taken down and realised that something was wrong, he asked for his medical dossier.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilised at the time of the birth and no-one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for her sexual organs to be able to develop.
Having learned the truth, he has now become a man, following a testosterone treatment and took a kidnap away.
The surgery made it sterile.
Now he is defending the cause of others in an organisation called Interface Project, which tries to standardise the perception of intergender people.
But Anne Tamar-Mentis, the chief executive of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Invenkice, fears that German law will encourage labelling and stigma.
Many activists worry that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child a "indefinite" sex.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to give male or female sex, and to wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mentis said that his organization supported Australian law because it permits adults to choose to be recognised under the third-sex name.
Adult people should be able to make their own decisions about a form of legal practice, she added.
The German law is about the allocation of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a specialist radiologist in mammography screenings in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is an assault on sexual development and helps thousands of people in a support group, has said that the German law will make parents and children more responsible.
The daughter of Dr Baratz, Katye, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called 'complete insensitivity syndrome'.
Because of the failure of its receptors in androgis, Katye has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagin, but she does not have a uterus or an ovaries.
Now it is 29 years old, and it is married and internally in childhood psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, it hopes to have children by means of adoption services or surrogate dams.
The law gives parents some latitude to avoid making rash decisions, said Baratz.
This gives them time to carry out certain tests and to understand them, and a time limit before the practice of using a pan-European policy for women.
So, all is well, you can raise your child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You must not rush into a surgical operation that is irreversible.
This puts children at the heart of the decision and mitigates the feelings of anxiety that drive parents because they are afraid not to do what needs to be done, she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what gender it feels most comfortable at ease and this is a wonderful thing.
This allows the child to make its own decision.
Fixing the Government's longevity
Italian Council President Enrico Letta has ruled that his government will hold until 2015, despite strong tensions between the left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his term of office.
In an interview with La Stampa, the center-left leader says that he firmly intends "to continue to govern with his coalition until the next general election in 2015.
The Upper House of the Italian Parliament will be meeting later this month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council who was convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw support from the government if the Senate, where he has more adversaries than his supporters, will dismiss him.
But some of his camp, led by the National Secretary of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 by his refusal to yield to Berlusconi's earlier injunctions.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect have been injured in the fire-fighting exchange.
Fire-fighters called the scene of the tragedy and said that they had answered a call to the effect that 'many people have been injured'.
"The police are on the spot," says the airport on its Twitter account, while television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shootings," said to the AFP a US Transport Security Agency (TSA).
The ABC local office showed a person evacuated from a brown wind, and a second transboundary on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at 9.30 a.m. (12.30 in Montreal) at terminal 3, and the airport was also specified.
The Los Angeles Times points out that two and three are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman could not confirm immediately whether one of its employees had been injured.
All flights to the arrival and departure of the airport were suspended.
Israel\ u0027s Army Hole a member of Hamas in Gaza
Israeli tank gunshots killed on Thursday an Islamist Palestinian activist Hamas and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, it was discovered after sources of the health service.
One source from Hamas has explained that fighting has broken out in the region, because Israeli tanks have crossed the border and were targeted by Palestinian mortishes.
The Israeli army merely referred to "targeted action" in the area close to a supposedly "terrorist" tunnel by Israel's power-grabbing state, whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign as though to drop Biden to Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors considered, in the greatest secrecy, a replacement for Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to The New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event to be seen in the much-needed book book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, the Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times got a copy of the book to appear, and reported on Thursday evening that the president's close associates had carried out extensive group and poll support in late 2011 to see if Biden's eviction might help Obama in re-election when his hopes were waning.
According to Times Martin's political correspondent, the book provides a comprehensive analysis of the work of senior campaign officials and the White House, the former White House Secretary-General Bill Daley, to see what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded in the Chicago QG and inside the Oval Office.
Only about a half-dozen close advisors to President-designate Daley, Obama's former leader, Jim Messina, and former White House councillors David Axelrod and David Plouffe knew that the change was being studied.
Down Down trials indicates that Daley led the post to replace Biden, despite their close personal cronies, before finally deciding against change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the "presidential list" did not improve Obama's chances of success.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had in fact considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
I have said that I have examined a whole range of issues, and that was one of them, said Daley to the newspaper.
Remember that, at that time, the President was not in the form, and therefore we said, that we could do with a great deal of effort.
While Daley referred to the study of a "coordinated" style, Martin indicated to Anderson the CNN's Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested much to find out whether the change would be beneficial in the election.
The campaigns do not spend a great deal of money on opinion polls and discussion groups unless they are serious about taking action in the field, said Martin out of AC360.
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he asked Daley whether his then boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Though Daley said that he did not believe that President-in-Office of the Council was aware of the possible change, the former Secretary-General has admitted that it is possible for Obama to have been able to do so.
Martin went on to say that, at the end of the day, it was not the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama did not know that Biden's eviction from the presidential list was being examined.
To be sure, Martin responded to Martin.
Do you want a fluid ice?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on duet.
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal in order to develop a light-and-choose collation.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on medals and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The icy cream reacts with the language by increasing the pH of protein to shine it.
Chris explains that, as the ice cream starts to light when it reacts to the warmth of the mouth, the more it is dry, the more it becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the society of ice-ridge Lick Me I' m Delibal spirit said: 'It is an incredible thing to do, but we are still in the early stages of production, and two g of this trit costs around ¬£200.
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice blows in.
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween, because it is having a tremendous effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice that I have created, because the lumination of medals is worth four times as much as gold.
So every butcher costs me about 140.
But it has a rather good taste!
The company at Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and the golden leaf.
But its next creation looks even more ambitious.
He went on to say: 'I would really like to develop an invisible ice.
This is intrinsically impossible because of the fraction caused by the ice levels that are the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do that.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the melted duped Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died at a snake sitting
The singer Lou Reed died at a time when he was carrying out Sochi exercises, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the "East Hampton Star" regional newspaper, which goes to the people of the town of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, when he was watching the trees and making the famous twenty-first movement in tai chi, with its musical musicians, writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, Chinese martial art.
The wife of the singer also said that she had promised her husband, the week before she died, to bring him out of the hospital and take it to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
Even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will pass on to many people the wonderful joy of life he had," she adds.
Lou Reed was subjected to a liver transplant last May.
Halting 2013: Figures
When I was a child, Hallopoulou was a magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, to go to each other late and to dress to reach the neighbourhood.
Today, I have become more stingy.
In the last two years I have not given out a single sweet, and I will certainly not do so again this year.
But the stastats show that I am the black sheep of Halloween.
The majority of Americans, most of whom are about 158 million, will, this year, cause Hallobound this year, spending a total of $6.9 Md in sweets, disguised and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I am looking forward to at every Halloac party is tendencies.
Remices should be 1.2 Md of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, the inanimated spacecraft is a furore.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the space of Daft Punk will be included among our photos Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after items are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I assume that there is no harm in remaining traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal dressing-up this year, according to the NRF.
There are many curious dogs dressed in hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, you do not land.
The Americans will spend $1.9 million this year, according to the Nielsen cabinet.
That is about 272 million kgs of Hershey, sugar, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and barres Clark.
This is a super-new for the 41 million children who go to the good guys in their vicinity, according to the American Department of Trade.
In fact, we will buy and, let us not fool ourselves, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Hallobound.
Maize sweets are the only thing we do not want to eat; yet almost 16 million kgs are sold for Hallobound, according to the National Confecture Association.
This amounts to about 9 billion corn grain.
It is a mystery that I have not yet managed to clear up.
Nothing is more Hallopoulou than the houses haunted.
They are about the best names, as is the case with the best names, such as, for example, the one-time model.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially-recognised houses in the United States, which generate about $500 in revenue, according to the 'America Haunts', and this includes the formidable photos of you, which your friends put on Facebook and which you cannot kidnap and on which a type of style that you like leaves a comment in the style of the style that you like.
Finally, I would like to talk about 'cities'.
Charlie Brown offered us the Growing Citrouille when you were gamble, and sculing a citrus in the form of lamp, is like decorating a Christmas tree is something we have done ever since.
Thankfully for us, the spirit of the 'baby-tanker' has started only last year, thanks to Pay, so most of us sculled these pools and did not sit back.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 M in cities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The moorland-moored citkers who wither softly on your house probably came from Illinois, where 542 million tankers were grown this year.
If you are looking for more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to lock their tanks of 922 kg.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a "bad bank" structure of GBP 38 billion (‚Ç¨45 billion) of riskiest assets, a move to ease relations with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% over the next two years, and hopes to have fully cleaned the balance within three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciation of additional bad debt from four to 4.5 billion pounds in the quarter, a writing that is linked to the establishment of the Box structure.
RBS also made it clear that this internal restructuring would free up ¬£10-11 billion in capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London pointed out that "bad bank" would draw a line under the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"Now we can move forward, we are concerned about the future and the 90% of assets that are a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom," said the new Director-General Ross McEwan in the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has only 6 percentage points of battling and seatbelts, and there is also a Intercom system.
Among the options are, in particular, improved brakes, a service which gives access to the sponsors of the Bowler Works, the logistical support and the storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, the head-general of Bowler Motorsport said: 'There has been a change in the number of enthusiasts of rallyes who reach Bowler.
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way of trying to try different forms of 'rallyes' in the United Kingdom and the international community, and to prepare for the laughers and the realities of the rallyes raids.
We have had a great deal of pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge vehicle, which is really going to be exciting.
Moreover, Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in deserts in North Africa and the Middle East.
The fire-fighters were called on to rescue a pupil lost after being stuck in 15 metres above the ground on an unstable niche in a career
Ruby, a thickness of Cocker, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was picked up three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in a career.
The fire-fighters took to the cliff to recover the Chilean and save it from a certain death.
A puppy had the good fortune to escape the worst after the fire-fighters were called on to recover him safely when he was lost 15 metres above the ground on the unstable supply of a cliff.
Ruby, a thickness of nine months, broke out after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days only before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years, went to the Flappit career in Denholme, in the West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire fire and aid service.
They desperately sought their lost Chilean, and launched a call on social network sites after it disappeared into the career following an accident without gravity.
At the time of 2.15 p.m., a person with a taste eye walking his dog spotted Ruby on a career corniche, crammed to 15 metres above the ground.
A technical relief team from the fire station of Cleckheaton went into the scene and went down in call to save Ruby using an animal-care stretcher to transport it to the cliff.
The technical aid expert Andy Clayton said: 'By contrast it was in a precarious situation.'
She was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
It did not move at all during the time of the 'crisis' being frozen.
But it is now going well.
It has eaten biscuits afterwards.
It was a very unusual appeal.
It is incredible that somebody has noticed the dog.
The technical aid expert Peter Lau said: 'Mr Ruby has been very fortunate to come out of it unscathed.
It could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted by the veterinarian for monitoring; his general state was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, Halifax in the West Yorkshire, said: 'I was horrified when I observed the aid. "
First of all, I did not believe that she was there.
It was surprising to have him again in the arms.
The veterinarian said that if it had been too exhausted and had disappeared, it would probably have fallen.
The fire-fighters have been slimmed off.
What they did was really brave.
They are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely tremendous.
Mr Alderson of Keighley added: 'If you are afraid, she is falling but she has not moved.
The fire-fighters have been super-super.
I cannot believe it was there.
Mr Jagger says that he never dramatised Katy Perry when he was 18 years old.
During an interview during an Australian radio programme this week, the pop star said that she was a lid on the song of Jagger's Die Hard-style Habits Die Hard Constas in 2004.
Perry said that he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, and I was drained when I was 18 years old.
She went on to say that it was a long time ago, and it was very kind.
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70 years old, said that he categorically denied that he made advance payments to Katy Perry.
The representative went on to say: perhaps she is confusing it with someone else.
Perry was one of the excheers to appear at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, the 'europPrisen', came out on the front bench this week.
Beijing's Islamic-based Movement
"The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the head of Chinese security bodies on a television station in Hong Kong, according to a video online on a website on a website on Thursday evening.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), spoke to Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official has appointed a special organisation after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uyghurs from the same family in the Xinjiang Muslim-dominated region, which borders several countries in Central Asia, precipitated their petrol-boggling car into Beijing in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The car driver, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to fight for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, formerly named Xinjiang Chinese, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among organisations affiliated to al-Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as being responsible for the occasional unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is called into question by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's collapse gives the Scots a choice.
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland will be required to join the European area of free movement in order to be able to join the EU.
Now we hear stories about passport control in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along the Hadrian Wall.
If it is true that the newspaper in Strathclyde indicated the possible economic fallout from greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that the EU Member States spend a large part of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, an ongoing non-compliance of the rules would be a slight concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from the Scottish people.
It is therefore a story that is not one of them.
And it is a story so old that it is now set in stone: I have heard for the first time the fog to the effect that independence means the monitoring of passports that were established over 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old, dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for Brussels, especially now?
The real news about Europe is this: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is finally at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Europe's Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or argue in favour of abandoning the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, Germany's "Altener Alternative" party, based only this year and came from nowhere, gained nearly five million votes in the federal elections in September, and left the Liberal Democratic Party (the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe Project went too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits, which were only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put its members at the mercy of German exporters "favourable exchange rates to what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the southern European countries find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-√†-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make swingeing cuts in the salaries and public spending that Berlin has promoted.
Beyond today's fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
As a result of the 'green green' energy policies imposed by Brussels, which are a reason to subsidise French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer, the European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a vexing inconvenience in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage gels in the world will prevent Europe's petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the revolt, particularly in France, is one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite regarded the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy in a difficult position.
As a result, Marine Le Pen's far-right party, the anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, returning the socialists to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the popular vote a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing split will automatically favour the left.
What is Le Pen doing with his new popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-European, single-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are a good figure in these elections, as is very possible, then such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I believe: very soon the anti-European and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and will end up killing off the euro.
The EU will not go away, but it will return to something that will increasingly resemble the Europe of Nations (sovereign) that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will look good to the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of the small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, and that includes sending in Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could live with a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should be emulating Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is in the right position, and it should be noted that the anti-austerity political movement that has done most well in Europe, having won a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed (and implemented) cuts by the Labour Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative / Liberal-Democrat coalition that has followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it was to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Purely early: Viegeing earlier
Studies show that young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical change does not mean that the puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty.
The trend toward early puberty is not so pronounced in boys.
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialising in family and health issues in the child.
Should a mother worry if his daughter's buckets and pools are starting to grow to seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrine, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American young people and represent a new standard.
As a result, I spend a great deal of time reassuring the parent parents in general, but that does not indicate a rapid development towards the full-puberted puberty, Kaplowitz.
The clear signs of development, such as the burgeoning of the buckets, the pools under their arms and in the chillian zone and the physical stench.
But there has been only a slight increase in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, whereas it was three-quarters of three-quarters in 1970.
At least two or three years are needed before the first rules appear, Kaplowitz, also the author of the Puberty Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Common Leader.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will develop.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered to be an early-warning when the development of the chest is accompanied by a sudden increase before the age of eight.
In most cases, development slows down or stops it is something that a paediatrician can follow closely.
A more rapid development can justify the tests carried out by a monologue in order to set aside serious problems such as tumors or hookers.
There are treatments to delay the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size to adulthood.
The recommendations for drugs and hormonal treatment are based on a child's age, development rates, growth rates and emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is prudent with drugs, but recognizes that taking control of puberty can alleviate some of the behavioural problems and the sensation for girls to be different from the others.
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young girls to have their rules.
They are afraid of the risk of pregnancy, or even the way in which they are going to manage the issues of hygiene in the air, has said Kaplowitz.
This was a shocking shock, recalling a woman whose daughter had her first rules at 10 years.
Even if there were signs, and we talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from the chilling and distressed school of being the first among her.
There are many theories of public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no coherent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He was involved in a study on girls aged between 6 and 9, which link the fat percentage to the trigger of the puberty.
Other discoveries support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
On a global scale, early-puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem is that, although boys have their faces on the face and in the youngest pubian zone, the trend towards a genuine early puberty is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference have highlighted the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acupuncture and of goods is common, even among infants and all-children.
We must be careful about the way in which we identify the true appearance of the puberty fighter, said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrine working at the Goryeb hospital in Morristown in New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their paediatrician how to talk to their child.
This might mean having a conversation earlier than was envisaged, explained by Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will do well in general.
Girls who are born at an early age must be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The Cost Hidly of the Codes
'Inside Llewyn Davis' of the Coen brothers, the Grand Price of the last Festival in Cannes, is a nostalgic film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate on it, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography was the subject of a retrospective look at the French mathouse, had picked up the Cannes Palace in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel, and Ethan Coen have thrown their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, and the global star pop Justin Timberlake.
In this mock movie of humor, where music is a central figure and its live songs, Oscar Isaac is a musician and folk of folk, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, is leaving the pop for mad music with a jubilee contagious.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich atours of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the superb" for the less inspiring clothing, a gentle voice when she sings, but the wire trotted into the machine when she speaks.
'Inside Llewyn Davis' tells a week about the trials of a folk singer who cannot be bored and get angry about the whole world.
It agrees to a reduction in the number of replacements at studios.
Without a home, he travels through the tags of his friends who want to receive it.
The air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, it is this that interests us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not sitting at the right time, who is not careerists, but integrates, with self-destructive behavior," said to his brother Joel of several Oscars and Cannes.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two film film film-makers have built their story on real figures of the time like the musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called "the epicentre of the rise in folk music that would generate international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then evokes a documentary, a dusty music label full of 33T that was dressed by an old-fashioned secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the songs were produced.
The fig of the Coen still plays a role in integrating a strange person who crosses the film all the time: a lovely cat in the eye, comrade Llewyn Davis.
When questioned about how he put his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake reminded us of "grew up in the Tennessee, bathed by the blast and the country's country."
"My first music lessons have been given to me by my grandfather, who taught me to play the guitare, 'he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the job is needed to "be seen as right," chance can also start someone's career, "and" more and more today. "
As Llewyn Davis, who rejects compromise on his music, the superpop explains that, in a career, 'the most important is not to be caught in the dark by anything that can prevent us from speaking'.
L√©rard de Villiers, the author of 'SAS', is dead.
He will never know the word retirement.
On the subject of the French edition, G√©rard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years, had just published its 200 SAS, 'The Vengeance of the Kremlin'.
In February, the New York Times devoted it as "the author of spying novels that knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, a theatre of the 198 and 1991 opes of the famous series of espionage novels.
As he was physically wounded by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was moving around during that journey with a traveller.
And before Afghanistan, he was also in Libya, Russia, Lebanon, and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, G√©rard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929, ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of 'SAS in Istanbul', the first of the series nearly half a century ago.
"Perhaps between 120-150 million of all countries," he argued last March.
His Burmese cat on his kingdom, in the showroom of his immense apartment in a building of the avenue Foch at two steps by the Arc of Triumph, the malicious eye under his white hair, he mentioned some of the languages in which SAS adventures have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese, or Korean.
"Not to mention the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books at the lower table between the thards or the ivoys reported from the 130 countries with books.
For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader has a right to traditional coverage with the photograph of a young woman with a portrait that is advantageous, with a pistol or an assault gun.
Inside, his anti-niscent (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat and a contractual agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the castle, gets into the hands of all the bad guys of the land, communists of the 1970s and 1980s, and then jihadists from the 1990 "s.
To every book, the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitics and exotism, a few scenes of hard-core gender, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never had the pretension to be a literary author," explained G√©rard de Villiers.
I see myself as a critic who writes to distract people from whom I do not send a message.
He was working 'like the great pre-war reporters, such as Albert London, who went there and went back with real and long-term investigations. "
SAS's father said: 'make a kind of geopolitical soap'.
"I am at all times my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before he left, 'added G√©rard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from the AFP, diplomats, from the people of the services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of its SAS are often premonitory: a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime that killed several senior officials, he told the story in the 'Damascus route'.
In "Benghazi's Hindus," he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in that city, the birthplace of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadat in "The Cairo plot," a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako," he wrote the columns of 4X4 jihadis who based on the Malian capital.
I am no guess, defending G√©rard de Villiers, I am simply making assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips to areas that are often troubled, he set off for a month behind his 1976-written IBM writer IBM, "all parts of which have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word 'FIN' and corrects every page in the pen.
His office's walls are filled with AK-47 rifles, erotic photographs and photographs of the perpetrator with African warlords.
Seriously pointed to machismo by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organisations, G√©rard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa, where I have a large number of readers.
L√©rard de Villiers said: 'Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age'.
He will not die and he will not retire.
No more than I do.
avioners are quarrelling about the size of the seats when big orders are at stake.
The quarrel between the large aircraft manufacturers over the size of the tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Aeronautical Salfair.
The conflict is about the proposed width of the proposed seats on long-haul flights to the passengers of the economic class of the European Union, which are not always the most courted by the airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential for increasing the efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard requiring a minimum seat of at least 18 lungs (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its big US-owned Boeing says that it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out when aircraft aviers are trying to sell even greater versions of their long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record record at the time of the event, which will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be ready for the back of the aircraft in particular will mean that there will be 9 or 10 head-of-war seats for the economic yield of the part of the mini-jumbo-jumbo-jumbo segment.
Boeing says that its LSE 777X reorganised will be able to accommodate 406 people in economic class 406 in seats in more than 17 broad-based seats and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will carry an economic class of 350 people from the seats of 18 large configurations of 9 a.m.
Aeronautical giants often change blows over technical issues by advertising the professional press.
Now, Airbus is calling directly for the public before the Dubai Aeronautical, where 777X should take over from its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have recently been able to see what might be the start of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financial side of a photograph showing three people against each other in the restaurant, entitled "Wave" you would accept that?
NEW Boeing proposes long-haul flights in narrower seats than in the ground-boggling regional aircraft, has indicated John Leahy, the commercial director of Airbus.
As eating habits change, people grow, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the jumbo 747 of Boeing set the modern long-haul journey, and the turn of the century the weight of the average American aged 40-49 increased by 10%, according to the US Health Department's data.
The average average of the average American in the twenty-first century is 39.7, according to America's health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival clings to a concept of siege that dates from the 1950 "s, when the circuses of the equipment known as the 'europjet set-up' was narrower.
Airbus adds that it has commissioned a study which indicates that a further boost to the level of the seat width would improve the quality of the 53% sleep.
Boeing contests Airbus's figures as regards the size of the seats and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how the airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not depend solely on the size of the seats.
It is really a question of flexibility for the airlines and allowing them to do what they think they have to do in order to carry out their activities, says Kent Craver, who is in charge of passenger satisfaction in Boeing.
They do not want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their businesses better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lurks, an aircraft-order race for an estimated $700 million at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tip America's and Europe's exports.
As Reuters pointed out for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the last appliances.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest long-haul bimoters 20% higher than that of the leader of the market in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER365 seats.
The performance of Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a model 777 of configured origin in nine.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the configured equipment with 10 per seat seats currently in service.
So-called Boeing is doing it in order to wear more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in comparison to our products, said Kevin Keniston, the director of Confort Passager at the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that shacks configured with 10 seats per quarch in the 777 seats suggest that many passengers are in favour of a dense configuration, which can go hand-in-hand with cheaper fares.
It would be perfect for passengers to have an 18-chicken-based seat, but the reality is that, from the commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777, has declared the internal reports of Mary Kirby boother and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines must choose.
Even those who sell aircraft that travel around the world are even taking a metre to check the competing configurations.
While being content to offer comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per boss but indicates that he has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus pointed to the need for greater personalisation of the booths by offering larger seats to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other large manufacturer of modern large aircraft, the experts say that it is unlikely that its call for the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for seats will be met, but that it could make us forget the 777X wave of sales.
The Oracles of Oracs
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and Director General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third-ever global fortune that has just been besieged by the victory of his boat at the America Cup.
The billionaire still has 25% of the software group's capital that he co-founded 40 years ago.
As early as last year, Ellison had voted against his salary.
Oracle boss renounced a $1.2 million bonus for 2013, closed in May because of the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but received about $77 million of stock options.
His fixed salary is merely a symbolic dollar.
Over the full 2013 exercise, Oracle's net benefit increased by 3.5%, while the stock price at a whopping 27.5%, the S & P-500 index rose by 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could take away the pleasure of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine could have protected the life of mice from addiction to nicotine.
Other tests are needed before trials on human beings begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell College in New York said that the first signs were encouraging.
We hope that this kind of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, using all the methods now available on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches to the law, said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then starts to produce a regular stream of antibodies.
Anti-bodies deal with all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice that was subsequently given the nicotine has continued to work normally.
But the mouse that had not been vaccinated was mollified, said the researchers, claiming that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine.
Previous anti-smoking vaccines have proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Liquidity had to be repeated so often that anti-body levels remain high that they are too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower, because it turns the cells of the liver into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use were completely safe, children could be administered before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and this may help them to lose their bad habit, he added.
British scientists have said that the results are interesting but have indicated that much more research is needed.
Pakistan's Taliban chief killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsouth, was killed in a strike by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, the security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsouth has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, military, and activist officials have said this time that he had lost his life in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsouth was killed in a drone fire," said a high level of security.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling to London, had informed the British Government that talks had been held with the Janrik Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi was influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
Former South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied that he had changed his trade policy at the behest of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled areas.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Drug (ICAC) expanded its inquiry to find out whether Mr Obeid had put pressure on a number of ministers in Circular Quay, where the Obeid has two restaurants and a coffee after they expired in August 2005, without there having been a call for tenders.
She is now investigating the allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former deputy secretary-general of Mr Tripodi, Mrs Lynne, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government pressed for a call for tenders to be made to leases.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, Bircular Quay's companies, which reported to Obeid about $2.5 per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of the Ports in February 2006 in November 2009, was initially in favour of the calls for tenders.
But he denied that he changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid who, Mr Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcription of telephone conversations to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who arrived at the Ports Ministry after having worked under the instructions of Mr Obeid in the Ministry of Pishches.
On the subject of this telephone-trading conversation, was the development of the policy on commercial bricks, and asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wlasy to Mr Tripodi.
On the contrary, Mr Tripodi replied.
I do not recall what we discussed, but in any case it was not that.
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes are targeting Syria, declaring a leader
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port town of Latakia on Thursday evening, confirms a military chief at Fox News.
The person responsible did not say what the target was, but he said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian state-of-the-art missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa could have to pass a test against authenticity.
The government is currently studying the possibility of putting in place a genuine test of authenticity for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa when it is considering extending repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied on a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used for unskilled jobs or as a roundabout way to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper has been unveiled today, as Labour MEP Maxine McKew denounced government discourse on foreign workers, saying that it might offend Australia's neighbors.
The striking statements about "stranger" and "jobs for Australians first" are a nasty return to the days when trade unions demanded a sheltered labor market, she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of whites needed to be protected, and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artefacts.
The working document mentions the 12 measures previously envisaged by the former immigration minister, Chris Bowen.
The immigration minister, Brendan O' Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet top officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the so-called authentication criterion were to be adopted, a visa-seeker could be checked to find out whether the supply of employment is genuine in the event that the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned in the company that sponsors him.
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, with the intention of sponsoring a small number of workers, actually employing hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker would have died from a heart attack after arriving on a boat transporting asylum seekers to the island this week.
The 9.mad 9-year-old son of the man went to Australia with him and found some comfort from his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on the island of Senegal, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the UK Government.
HS2 Ltd's work suggests that high-speed services in Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Transport Minister, Baroness Kramer, has said that the project is to bring the United Kingdom into line.
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keith Brown, has said that she is a hard-working supporter of working with the UK Government on the project.
Phase 1 will deal with a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will be taken by Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England from ¬£32.7 Md to ¬£42.6 Md.
The UK Government, which is holding talks with transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of journey times for the north of England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of three hours at most.
Baroness Kramer said: 'Keep our aim for HS2 is a truly national network which will bring the UK and its cities closer together.
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
However, it is also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 big UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the links between them are better by HS2.
The UK Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, has added: the announcement today is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown has called on Mr Carmichael to give unequivocal support to Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: 'High-speed train has the potential to bring considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but he is also putting the economic weight of Scotland into the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
So we are excited at working in partnership with the UK Government to look at the options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh route that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide on the next steps together.
The rules on the use of electronic appliances on board are still in force in Australia.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to extinguish their tablets and smartphones during the take-off and landing, despite the United States "move to soften the regulation of electronic devices.
The American Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to American carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in the form of a 'shadow plane'.
Passengers can already do it for most of the flight, but many people find it difficult not to have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining the decision that obliges US carriers to carry out important work in order to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the short term.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has also said it is looking at the announcement but pointed out that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment in the form of aircraft, she said.
The issue is regulated, obliging aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained on a permanent basis and passengers must respect the safety requirements provided by crew members.
Virgin, which has already referred to CASA with its intention of extending the use of its on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but has said that it will follow the regulator.
We would welcome a review of CASA, which would make it possible to use electronic equipment, because we really believe that this would improve the client experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi) on our fellow-aircraft, has indicated a spokesperson.
Qantas said it was complying with the current rules for the time being.
In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend immediately to change this, she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look carefully at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to show that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as to review the training manuals, training equipment, hand luggage and the instructions to passengers.
As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic books readers and smart phones to all the top altitudes, said the FAA.
In the few cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to switch off their aircraft during the landing season.
The group also recommended that the heavier aircraft should be placed safely under the seats or in the top compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four people are injured in a violent fight.
The small municipality of Pia has had an unusually high fever on Thursday evening.
Three Gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a trough of around 30 people according to the testimonies collected...
On the day of Halloween, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia, where a rixing by several people broke out on the side of the postal service.
At least four slight injuries are to be deplored.
Alerted, the police went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the injured are looked after.
Singapore's Mortgage Lictators benefit from the middle classes who are forced to tighten their belts.
In a mortgage lender for the commercial center of Babyeer in Singapore, Janani Amirriinga tabled a bracelet, a joke, and a pair of gold bucket to pay the tuition fees of his daughters.
My husband and I have just bought a house, so all my money is in the hands of Mrs Amiraud inga.
Although it earns $3,000 of Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is increasing at the rate of ValueMax, where it carried out its transaction, has this week become the third largest mortgage company to be introduced into the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Putting jewellery on a par is not just a quick way to get cash from Singapore's $1,300 of cash in the case of Mrs Amirderinga in her case, but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, mortgage lenders in Singapore raise an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same trading centre.
But mortgage lenders have the advantage of not asking for solvency or pay proof, and can unlock loans more quickly than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgage lenders, while families feel the pressure of rising cost of living and excessive household and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by excessively lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to mortgage lenders to fill the gap as their economies experience a slowdown.
This week, the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency cited the increasing indebtedness of households, mainly as a result of the increase in mortgages, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore are recording the highest level of household debt / GDP in Asia.
Malaysia heads the list with 80% of GDP, compared to 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
The bottom line is that, with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom of the wage scale are seeking to supplement their income as they can, says Song Seng Wun, an economist at the ICMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have meant that people have been quick to gamble their personal effects in order to touch their jewellery's value in cash.
In Singapore, around 70% of the articles on which government loans are made in the 200 loan shops in the city state are gold.
People say, the gold price is high, put the chain of grandmother's gold in check, and they will be picked up again next month.
In Thailand, the largest mortgage-loan provider, EasyMoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the mortgage sector such as ValueMax, the Bandeer operator and 15 other shop stores like the one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring neighboring Malaysia, where there are already four "hot shops" but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his chief executive.
Society will fund them by using 60% of the $66 million in Singapore that it raised this week when it was introduced on the Singapore stock exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have been subject to criticism for the exorbitant interest rates that they have, Miss Yeah says that mortgage lending not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it does not increase the debt directly.
It is said that the customers mortgage assets that they already possess, and the monetization of their personal assets does not increase the indebtedness of the household sector.
Praise is increasingly socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term.
Nor are the people who travel to mortgage lenders merely those with financial problems.
The rich people of Singapore are also going to the loan shops on ValueMax to provide gold linkleys or Rolex monsters, who can make up up to 60% of their cash purchase prices.
We see clients in every section of society.
This can be easy-to-do people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial or investment activities, or small businesses with cash-flow needs to pass a difficult course, Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pasteur of juvenile pornography in New Scotland
A pastor who was concerned about young people in the region of Halifax in New Scotland is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
Timberlay's Baptist church, where the unofficial pastor, is deeply disheartened by this news.
In a press release, church officials indicated that Mr Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not talk to people under 18 and do not have access to the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court, in Halifax, in December.
It goes to the supermarket in a uniform way, before it is taken away from it.
A man, dressed in a Nazi uniform bar of a blend with the Gogama, was asked to leave an English supermarket, with clients complaining to the head of the establishment called the police, indicated on the shop on Friday.
"We have received a number of complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the shop," said a spokesman in the Asda supermarket.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time it arrived, he had already left without a hitch," she added.
I was queuing up when I saw a woman who seemed to be upset.
People were sick.
"You don't walk out in the street unless you want to attract attention," testified at a click, Rosina Rusin, 60, in the Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, the day of the Halloween party, where it is customary to get out of the monster, but it was difficult to know whether it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I have a dark black bream two times a week in Asda," said Paul Dutton, who says that he is suffering from "mental problems."
The Tasmanian Health System's 325-dollar bailout plan
The federal government maintains that the $325 per dollar bailout for the health-care system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government of the state will not waste the funds.
The Federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the Commonwealth is currently adopting urgent emergency measures to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high level of chronic diseases and the system's constraints.
The funding, which is planned for four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent MP in Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
The government has proposed an emergency rescue package which, in our view, will resolve the unique difficulties faced by the state, said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 M Plan includes a $31 M campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
Another 2 600 operations, especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
Funds are also available for clinics without an appointment in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical staff, mental-health services, and the deployment of electronic health-care systems in local hospitals.
This investment responds to the view that, according to first-line clinicians, this is the best way to cure the health system of Tasmanic, Mrs Plibersek.
The minister said that the government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict regime for preparing reports and for providing an account.
The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which they are spending the extra funds.
A three-person committee will be set up to ensure that the state provides the services in the most effective and efficient way possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much less than a genuine reform to consolidate the public-health system of Tasmanic.
He did, however, congratulate the government on having responded to his urgent request for assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the public health system from Tasmania to the blacklist, Mr Wilkie.
According to the government government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But the opposition's health spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement was a quick-fix solution.
The reason why we are here is that the Labour government of the state has withdrawn $430 per dollar from its health-care system, he said on ABC TV.
You cannot have a government of the state that is scaling up nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth, which puts $300 million into the hands of $300, and say that it is a good day.
Mr Dutton has visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package will be spent on extra bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Wilhelm Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is full of remarkable artistic leadership and careful recovery, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
When she was in France in the 1760 "s, she tells Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a couch by his family.
When she rebel, she faces the ruthless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Mother, and becomes a subject of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pays into the lubricity or the sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The solemnity of the narrative could also become a penalty for the public.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, says the monitoring body
Syria has destroyed equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, declared the international monitoring body for chemical weapons on Thursday, while violent clashes in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived one day ahead of the deadline.
1 November set by the Hague-based organisation of Damascus, which ordered Damascus to destroy or make unusable use of all chemical weapons production units and machinery designed to mix toxic gases and fill up ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1 000 tonnes of chemicals and chemicals, especially mustard gas and the toxic neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made at a time when the fighting took place on Thursday in the town of Safirm which, according to the experts, is home to a chemical arms production unit and also storage sites, has reported on the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The group of activists, which is following the development of the human balance toll thanks to a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120 296 people had died.
Among these, it is estimated that there were 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29 954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces were killed, 18 678 of whom were pro-government fighters and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah activists.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2 202 were deserters and some 5 375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100 000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure ever since.
Some 2 million people have had to flee the country because of the conflict.
The al-Assad troops are fighting against the rebels, many of which are linked to al-Qa'ida's network groups in Safirm for weeks.
The Centre said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any details.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a protracted civil war.
A statement by the OIAC, working in close cooperation with the UN, indicated that his team was now satisfied that it had controlled and destroyed all the critical production and the machinery for mixing and filling.
She added that, for the time being, no other inspection activity was planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first stage of the verification work, when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They have not been able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety and indicated the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OIAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, left behind and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.
It was difficult to know at first glance whether Safirm's unit was one of the two sites that the OIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a comprehensive plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OIAC Executive Committee.
And, while I salute the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult task of this organisation, Ahmet Uzumcu, the head of the Ahmet Uzumcu organisation, in a commentary by the OIAC.
Now, in its third year, the civil war is mainly pitting Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government and security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the head of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said that there had been a large explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Colonstrations caused by the death sentence imposed on one of the Bali bombings.
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost a decade on the flight as one of South-East Asia's most wanted men, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man has been found guilty of mass murder for two night-time attacks in Kuta's popular tourist district, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many people.
It has also been found guilty of many other charges against terrorism, including a wave of attacks against churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors have requested a sentence for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked for the man, who was referred to as the man-martier in the bomb-making field, to be condemned to death.
The decision rekindled painful recollections of the Pth mother, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction carried out by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
When she was weeping in tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think that he should have followed the same route as other men.
On the contrary, he should be dragged to the firing squad, Mrs Corteen said to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, which was charged with an external bar, exploded just after 23 ph on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy' s Bar when a suicide bomber blew up an explosion full of explosives to barely 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into the coma after the attack and was unconscious for a month, and he was ripped to death three times as he was on life support.
Hugues said that Patek should have suffered the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah, who was responsible for the carnage of Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been condemned to death before others.
To keep it alive, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Moving 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others is not very much.
Patek is the last bomber in Bali to be brought to justice.
He managed to avoid being captured for nearly 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill the former Al Qaeda chief, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI official said that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in order to restore links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
In the second instance, he did not make it, she added Mrs Corteen.
Until recently, he could not care less about what grief he had caused to others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
On the contrary, there will be many tears in the year 2000, as Mrs Corteen said.
Patek can, however, appeal for his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not switch to their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic appliances as door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music, but will not talk about their cellular telephone in accordance with the new very much-anticipated directives published by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which change will be in place will vary from one airline to another, said the FAA Administrator, Michael Huerta, at a press conference.
The airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules on the fitting of aircraft to comply.
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the companies that have already submitted plans.
On the basis of the plan, we could agree to the wider use of electronic equipment very soon, and that is what the FAA said in a statement.
At present, passengers must switch off their smartphones, tablets and other appliances as soon as the gates of the plane are closed.
They are not supposed to rekindle them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to put their aircraft out when they fly off before the landing and not rekindle them until the plane has been put.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landings and landings, has declared FAA.
Most of the new online aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi in higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, chairman of the Association of Professor essional Flight Attendants, has expressed his satisfaction with these changes.
Once the new policy has been implemented safely and we are going to work in close cooperation with the transporters to do this will benefit everybody, says' Glading 'in a statement.
We are, quite frankly, tired of feeling like overcrowding in the Chamber when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet in order to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data to below 10 000 feet, has declared the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft in their hands.
So, not Words With Friends, the Scrabble online game played by Alec Baldwin's smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out to the tune of an American Airlines plane after refusing to switch her aircraft while the device was inside the door.
And the heavier appliances, such as laptop computers, will always have to be put in order, because they could injure someone if they stole through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory power regarding mobile phones belongs to the Commission's Federal Communications and not to the FAA.
The FAA can lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, Mark Rosenker, said that mobile phones are still considered to pose a risk.
Mobile phones are truly a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because, according to the FCC, we know that they could disrupt the mobile phone relays if they are used on the ground, Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government permit a wider use of personal electronic equipment.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as McCaskill, D-Mo, argue that there are no valid safety grounds for such bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of appliances has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers are forgetting to switch off their aircraft, or are doing so deliberately.
FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
The new airliner aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of airplanes, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by FAA.
The airlines have allowed their passengers to use the Wi-Fi at the altitudes of cruises for several years.
Unmodified aircraft to receive Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners should allow the wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic equipment usually emits much weaker power transmissions than previous generations of appliances.
E-books, for example, only emit minimum transmissions when one turns into a page.
But transmissions are stronger when equipment downloads or sends data.
Amazon.com is one of those that are pressing for a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, society's leaders charged an Kindle airliner airliner plane and rode him to see if there were problems, but there were none.
This has inspired the members of the FAA advisory committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of appliances presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that interference from appliances was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members have said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots who state that aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA should allow pilots to ask passengers to switch off their equipment during landings to instruments with low visibility.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them sensible arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that an agreeable passenger experiment is not incompatible with security, said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Work Association.
An H√©lituude bird of a platform in the North Sea has been released into the environment.
One bird, h√©lituude, after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into the environment.
They climbed the water from a helicopter to Aberdeen in the last month before he was set aside by the Scottish SCP in its Alloa bailout.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: 'Waterners were probably a winter headache who came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.
It seems that the exhausted bird would have been able to find refuge on the oil platform.
He went on to say: 'I am unable to fly again, so we have been contacted to help.
The male male male man was in good health when he was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of gathering businesses and defining what wealth and employment creators want to see changed in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey of British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought about Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, typically representative of all the sizes of businesses, industries, and regions of Britain.
The findings of the inquiry will come as a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of businesses are now seeking to export outside Europe, by focusing on those countries that are modernizing and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritise new trade ties with countries like China, India, and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming Europe's institutional arcane.
When asked what their views are on specific political points, ranging from the regulation of monopolies to the laws on products, the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area that is the equivalent of 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, are even in agreement.
Finally, and more specifically, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue the initiatives to change the Treaty and to develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is to be found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business community is insisting on significant, significant change which will return power to the United Kingdom.
The stakes are high enough to change the Treaty and better represent Britain's interests would allow a 16% swing in the votes to keep the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt about this: this survey shows that British companies are supporting this plan to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership with the EU.
It also shows that businesses hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of UK businesses, since the eurozone is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our inquiry show, for businesses this means to re-emphasise trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.

Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the gas pipeline in Bulgaria heralds a new era of gas.
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's biggest energy projects, declared the head of Gazprom.
A historic event has taken place today: the construction began in Bulgaria's South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in the Europe of the future, has explained Alexei Miller, the head executive of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream should make it possible to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, through which most of Russia's gas is transported to Europe, increases the level of risk in relation to conventional routes, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, which is a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are being eliminated for good.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced tariff as soon as the whole project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom has indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest naval reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest naval reserve, announced the newspaper's New New Times on Thursday, containing information from Radio Australia.
This island, in the east of the Gambier Archipelago, is the last British South Pacific territory midway between New Zealand and Chile.
It is 47 km2, if you include three other small, close islands.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutiny from the Bounty, the English navy's story that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutiny, still inhabit Pitcairn, and their incomes depend at 95% of London's generosity.
The island's Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, that is 836,000 km2, corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask the United Kingdom to endorse this request.
Mike Warren, the Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to provide sanctuaries for the 836,000 km2, but only if it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport at Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to build one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where military surveillance vessels are placed.
As for France, it must already carry out the expensive air and sea monitoring of the five million km2 of the French EEZ's ZEE, which is next door to Pitcairn.
The FAA relaxes the restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft, but it will still be banned from making calls on mobile phones.

Prison in Life for a former Chinese Vice-Governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, in northeastern China, was sentenced to prison for corruption on Friday.
Excluded by the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan-based yuan, reported Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Vice-Governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jilin, had helped businesses and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first interim tribunal on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the Communist Party's very existence.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as uncompromising with powerful "tigers" as well as "flies" - then only a handful of senior officials were condemned, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most dramatic recent case was that of the CCP's former leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest offices in the state.
But the government has shown no intention of reforming the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent organization of the party.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord, during a royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of South Wales's YMCA have been charged with sexual assault against children following allegations of Caringbah's educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a royal Commission hearing charged with child sex abuse.
But in his opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said that he had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within his organisation.
Director-General Phillip Hare was asked about two cases: an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he was working in 1991.
Mr Hare said in Gail berness, a consultancy to the Commission, that he was aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate in pointing out that the YMCA's external controls have been carried out and have indicated that the security of children is an absolute priority for the organization.
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA was informed that he had received the second-rate assessments of four establishments at a high-quality audit of the Department of Education and Control carried out in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who began working at the age of 21, admitted that the management of staff was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and he failed to check that the employees knew they had to report on any violation of children's safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys for the two years he worked in the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum prison sentence of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from pointing out Lord's shortcomings in children's safety.
The staff testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with children, that he kept them in private, told them that he loved them and let them play their mobile phones.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had asked for training in the area of child protection because she was worried about her behaviour, indicated that she was responsible for the services of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who was running a very daunting and difficult time to approach most of the time.
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimonies of the staff who said that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their top hierarchical.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord have clouded their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr Hare said that he had expressed his point of view before the board of the YMCA in South Wales saying that, for the organisation, the lesson drawn from the Jonathan Lord-style incident should not be about the signed signature by the staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr Hare said that the decision to have confidentiality agreements signed by the staff, shortly after the allegations had been made, was taken by the Director-General of the YMCA, who is responsible for children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence, but that it was an over-zealous exercise and has been badly implemented.
South Wales's YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was an employee, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Hughes workers at Griffith University's University in Griffith University.
He indicated that there were serious problems with recruitment, control, initiation, training and the supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would use the opportunity to become prime minister, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, 59 years ago he expressed his views on various national policies.
From his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as special envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair said, according to the Evening Standard of London: Yes, of course, but it may happen, so......
When many quaestor experts met in Cardiff to stand up and win the trophy of the year, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirwithin, a three-year-old child.
Not yet at school, and only a few months after he made his first arms, the tiny and his Shetland Toffee were traded for the three rounds with great ease and won the first price, leaving the other 30 adult competitors behind.
The two unscerably large of these have been saluted for the presentation, attitude and style of the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank center, at Ruden near Cardiff.
When he turned to men and women in the elegant twins, he wore his flat-bedded flat to roam his two-year-old poy Toffee around the runway.
Judge has been welcomed by the judges for his natural qualities of setting up little in common for a child of his age.
And Toffee received some very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton was Toffee as a gift to his 3rd birthday last March, and has since been dragged into Shetland every day.
His mother Donna, 30 years old, said: 'Mr Fenton and Mr Toffee have been doing a very good job.
They turned out to and against everyone, but both flunked the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time that he was competing with Toffee and we were crazy that he had won.
On the runway, people who did not know he thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to appear photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyung, near Ebbw Vale, in South Wales is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howeda, who has been taking part in quaestor competitions for over 10 years.
She said: 'If you had electricity in the air, everyone encouraged it and applauded it.
He has come through the whole length of the runway and even if he seemed to be a tiny man he did a wonderful job.
Fentless is a mad man from one-day animals, adore the horses of horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens to look after.
I am sure that he will soon be attending the Sheval demonstration in the year 2000, and I am sure he will do a great job.
One spokesman for the annual demonstration said: 'Well done Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to drive his dney.
They are a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were good and the way they marched through the runway.
They are looking for effective team work between the poney and the trainer, Mr Fenton and Toffee, have been the best on the trail.
I am sure his lovely clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call for a second-to-one will be redesigned.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reworked, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted to his television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-state society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a full-scale overhaul, says the regulator.
The second-rate system is the administration of Guangdon for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and television.
A preliminary inquiry has shown that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News, had published a number of misjudgments about the company Zoomlion's company, between September 2012 and August 2013.
The New Express was disorganised, said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into who is responsible in New Express, and immediately revise the leadership team of the newspaper, New Express.
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities by a shipyard manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published a first-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then he appeared on a public television station where he admitted he had published false stories about money.
In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion and the media industry and their ability to win the trust of the public sector, he said to the CCTV public television network.
I did so mainly because I was travelling after money and celebrity.
I was aware of my mistake.
Following Mr Chen's apology, New Express wrote his first-page apology, writing that he had failed to check his articles correctly.
Several important suspects have recently made television admissions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was adopted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles-de-de Gaulle aircraft 'unavailable'
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the move.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear heating stations in mid-October, when the boat was in the sea, was "safe for the sailors," but it is not without consequences for the navy.
Indeed, the Kingdom has confirmed to us' the unavailable 'of the vessel until' mid-November ',' time to take the necessary corrective measures' on the reactor.
For its part, the DNC company, which specialises in defence shipbuilding, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, who are sent from the Var for the time being, are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier '.
For them, among other things, it is a matter of changing a pump on the faulty heatery.
"All is being done so that Charles de Gaulle can deploy his planned deployment by the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Certificary of certifying that 'this does not in any way undermine the ship's nuclear propulsion programme.
Let us remember that the Charles-de-de-de-de-Gaulle aircraft is travelling from an intermediate six-month period.
He had laid down Toulon in mid-October for a training force.
This applies, in particular, to the description of young hunting pilots.
A 'small fault', contained within the space of reactor confinement, had occurred on the flagship ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year now, I have been very unhappy for more than a year now: a monstrous revaluation of their property, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds and administrative costs.

It is also distressing to see the expropriation of several property in order to receive a major industry that has never arrived.
I do, however, give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the tax payers?
It is not public palioners who invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.

Storage for a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico that has its own railway track
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and track track systems, has been discovered.
The United States authorities have described the 4-foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secrets they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant, on an equivalent length of six long football grounds, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, and the United States.
The area is full of wet warehouses, which makes it easy to conceal the heavy-duty trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out without anyone noticing, said the authorities.
The authorities have seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to the judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intention of selling.
They are given a prison sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for life imprisonment if they are condemned.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers are exploiting vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered following marijuana harvests in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to the drug cartels, which must quickly supply their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage from around 700 railway stations equipped with railways operating from the kitchen in a Tijuana house and went to two warehouses in San Diego.
The British Police issued an Extradition Mandate to the Assange
The British police have now issued a mandate for the extradition of the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who took refuge in the Ecuadorial Ambassador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said that she had issued a 40-year-old surrender notice for Australian, asking it to run to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following the allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting every possible avenue under British law after the Supreme Court ruled his appeal against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge in the Ecuadorial Ambassador in London on 19 June asking this South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has issued a surrender notice against a 40-year-old man who is asking him to appear at a police station, on the date and time of his choice, has declared a spokesman.
It continues to violate the conditions under which it has been set up on bail.
The ambassador refused to comment on the delivery of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he could be charged with spying, having uncovered more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Turn Our Lives
No more talk about slamming their smartphones or paying for what they buy?
American, French or Japanese researchers tell us of a future in which we will be recognised by biometric captors of telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, the deputy director-general of Morpho, believes that 'the century will be biometric'.
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person making transactions in such a transfeit and transnational world as the Internet.
Organisations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this infatuation for biometrics, but worry about it.
In 2011 and France alone, the National Committee on Information and Freedoms authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, shape of the hand or the network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens and so on.
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere, anywhere," the Justin Brookman, who is responsible for the private lives of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, on both sides and pessimism among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to make new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are the fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the porous network of the palm or the fingers.
But each of these technologies has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work the concrete have the very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, the technical director of the identity area in Thales Communications Security.
And the gathering and the verification of the network and the outline of the hand demand a voluntary and accurate gesture by the people.
It is a security - we cannot capture these data without knowing it - and a disadvantage: sometimes the procedure has to be repeated and it takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for some twenty years on other approaches, such as recognition of the face or iris (the colorful part of the eye).
As a result of the increase in the accuracy of the captors and the ability to calculate the computers needed to analyse the data, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased ten-fold over the last five years, calmed Cyrille Batgo, director of the Accenture Laboratory Laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using face-to-face recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an irksome in motion.
"Now we are carrying out research into the recognition of voices or ways of stepping on the way for noise captors, but we need a quiet environment ', says Sridhar Iyengar, the head of security research at the Intel Labs.
A unique and unforgivable DNA, DNA also raises hopes and worries.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered to be biometric biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, head of studies, innovation, and the outlook for CNIL.
But the DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC proposes to the judicial police a valve costing EUR 90,000 to analyze DNA samples in the place of a crime and in one hour.
Biometric uses are divided into two groups: identification (recognising one person among others) and authentication (making sure that the person is the one she claims to be).
Identification has until now been about the issuing of identity papers: biometric elements (fingerprints, photograph, iris) must be dealt with with the information that the state has on all citizens who are already committed.
This makes it possible to ensure that one person does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC therefore proposes that the VIP be recognised when a hotel or a store has entered the country.
"We are recovering images of surveillance cameras and comparing them to the photos of the famous famous persons who move freely on the Internet," says Dany Nassive, who is in charge, at NEC level, of trade development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: taking a photograph, queuing in a shop, following his progress through face-to-face recognition and to calculate waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, shelves, canteens, and so on) or logic (opening a computer).
In addition, the monitoring of presence has been added to it.
'One biometric pointed-out which avoids the phenomenon of a loaf that points to another, "Cyrille Batgo, Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also affect transactions, especially those carried out using Internet-based devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing its card and putting its hand on a biometric reader: it replaces the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d Ascq and Angoulmyself by the natural state Security Security, in partnership with large-scale banks and teachers: when they pay in shops with their banking card, the client does not tag its code, but introduces its finger into a reader who breaks the veins.
The experiment is set to last for six months.
If concluded, biometric readers could soon arrive at French retailers.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways of making biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains in the hands of thirty seconds less, then that is good," says the head of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years' time, a vocal server will be able to recognise your voice and offer you options to measure.
Finally, let us reassure the precautions taken to protect the databases.
'Fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocking its use ', lists Philippe Robin Hood of Thales.
But, without thorough studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches are really convincing the users.
The specialists in the protection of privacy continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the increase in the number of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst:" blanket surveillance, "predicted by Andrew Patrick, of the United Nations High Commissioner for the Protection of Privacy in Canada.
A driver travelling at 210 km / h with a hot drink between the legs has been saddled with an amputation of ¬£1 000.
A car driver was fined ¬£1 000 for rusting at 210 km / h, with a bumpy, balanced drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted leading his Mercedes Benz on the A120 to Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped it, they discovered the drink to be carried away between their legs.
At the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the breach of conduct without the necessary care and care.
The seven points withdrawn from his permit led to a 6-month driving ban.
Howie was also condemned to the cost of ¬£90 and a surcharge for ¬£100.
Taxes on Foreign Hondholders to burst the London bubble
The Treasury provisionally quantified the measure of the tax on capital gains, but awaits a final decision by Mr Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has written a stamp duty of 7% for properties costing more than ¬£2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to own property in a company rather than an individual company.
The duty of stamps is already applied to residential properties in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and is the equivalent of ¬£708 for the 2012 / 13 tax year, which exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr Cook said: 'Further to the increase in the duty of stamps on high-value property and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that the high-value properties are under-imposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete residential tax system.
But this could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London, or current landowners who are reluctant to sell, added.
The high-prestige real-estate prices of between 5% and 10% of the prices of real estate in the prosperous south-west of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the last year.
Prices in central London show a 5.6% annual annual growth rate of 5.6%, but have been eclipsed by a growth-oriented internal market, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and is (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movement of a dog's tail is in proportion to its mood.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs are still queuing to the right (from the dog's point of view), while the nervous dogs moved it to the left.
But now the scientists are saying that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Thirty, said: "Everyone, the left side and the right of the brain are involved in different ways in stimulating positive or negative emotions.
Here we have tried to see what happened with other species.
He added that, as in humans, among dogs, the right of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly queues of other dogs, researchers have been watching animals looking at films made by other dogs.
They have measured the cardiac frequency of animals and analysed their behaviour.
Surely it will not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara has explained: 'We have presented the movie dogs which have been shown to be a naturalist or a figure figure to avoid any further confusion and we have been able to tamper the tail movement and present it as running to the left or right.
When the animals saw a dog with no form of expression moved the tail back to the right (from the point of view of the tail that wins the tail), they remained completely at a standstill.
But when they got a tail mostly to the left (again from the dog's point of view), their heart attacks accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not believe that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he believes that dogs know by experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He went on to say: 'If you meet with other dogs on several occasions and if you see that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right to a less friendly attitude, you will react on the basis of this experience.
Researchers say that the results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to gain a better understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The expert in canin John Bradshaw, a professor at the University of Bristol University at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs looked to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
And, in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said that, when his tail was turned to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious about the opposite of what is in the Italian study.
He pointed out that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs involved in the various studies did not entirely see the animals in films or robots as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
It is true that, although many of the evidence from various mammals shows that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be clarified, and the dogs are no exception, he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be registered, it will surely not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes ends on one side and sometimes on the other.
On the eve of the illness of Alex Turner, a concert in Glasgow, a concert in Glasgow.
The band of band Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after a lynch was diagnosed with his singer.
Sheffield's group was to take place on Friday in the concert chamber The Hydro in the city centre.
But his lynch is forcing the singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert to the LG Arena LG in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Monkeys said: 'Further to the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena LG in Birmingham this evening and after requesting a medical opinion, they must also postpone the spectacle to the Hydro de Glasgow on Friday 1 November.
In the case of Alex Turner, he suffers from a lynch and regrets that he will not be able to happen in concert.
The spectacle at the LG Arena de Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the one in the Hydro de Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All notes remain valid for these agreements.
We wish to apologise to all those who hold the ticket for any inconvenience caused.
Thank you for contacting the client service at the ticket ticket where you bought your tickets for all supplementary aid.
Pope Fran√ßois will call his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointing new Cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking church members of the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect it, therefore Fran√ßois will nominate his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinles.
However, once a Cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of a third-rate Pope, it is therefore up to a group of 120 cardinal turkeys.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a gathering gathering of all existing turkeys would be held before the ceremony at which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of Cardinal, known as the "Gone."
The Fran√ßois Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Protocol in advance in order to make it easier to plan other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from various parts of the world under the auspices of Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Voice Catholic said that by February the number of cardinals will probably have dropped.
He said that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed for the number of cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals as he wanted.
Next year will be an important year because it will be the first since the election of Pope Fran√ßois in March of this year, Valero.
At the moment, there is a sort of trend towards favouring Europe, and Italy in particular.
It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will name cardinals from the rest of the world in order to restore the balance in the field, he added.
Forty per cent of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals are.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis has formed the board of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals of the entire world charged with investigating how to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on its own.
Now Fran√ßois has chosen these eight cardinals to help him, explained Valero.
He went on to say that he was entirely possible to achieve the effect that Fran√ßois asks for cardinals.
However, we have never experienced such a situation in a totally new way.
Valero said that popes typically raised bishops representing large communities at Cardinal's rank, but that Fran√ßois was full of surprises, so we do not know who will call the shots.
GM recalls some of his new pickets in the United States to repair the issue of seats.
General Motors Co is reminiscent of nearly 19 000 of its most recent pickings Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to settle a problem with the knife files, according to a statement made on Friday by the American body responsible for regulating vehicle safety.
On some pickings, the seats before could prove to be lacking in the knife mechanism.
As a result, the dossiers do not meet the federal safety standards of vehicles with head heads.
If the vehicle is pearted by the back, it may be that the head-head does not adequately protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury, according to the declaration on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The models mentioned were constructed between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickings began in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its collapse and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickings of default during the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16-day cessation of government activities, which slowed down the growth in vehicle sales in October.
The sale of pickech Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, have increased by around 20% in the first 10 months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickech Silverado and 16 503 pickstart Sierra.
GM prices soared by 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
An Infectious Employer is now buried under concrete blocks.
A construction worker has been buried buried under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before midday, in Montreal.
The drama occurred at around 11 a.m, on the street Marquette, right next to the intersection on the street, in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations has been going on there for some time.
A shabby foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident took place at a time when the victim had just arrived at the site in order to recover his tools.
I was by car, and I saw the wall come crashing down with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who is still close to the building site.
I am landed and I have been taking the big bricks out of it.
It was only one part of his back that was so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in the fifties who worked for a single-box company.
Resorations of resuscitation have been attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
A health and safety inspector inspector has been sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
Obama's Election of Despair
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says that Obama made laudable efforts in the Republican Party's obstructionism.
obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site nor the drones attacks.
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying in 2nd Year of Medicine at Harvard's Faculty University.
I am reading a horribly sad book these days.
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the moroseness of the 2th year of medicine and would give me some hope.
It is called 'the Audacity to Win' and it is the memoirs of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I went away, this book takes me back to the time when policies inspired millions of people and when speeches could cut you off.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory, and the presentations of news stories took the time to ponder the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cry with joy and my parents have kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries advanced to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable views.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult wake-up call, as it were, out of a dream.
It is difficult to recall these days full of optimism, as remote memories, a sad reminder of past opportunities.
The change really happened in the years following the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I am putting to Obama's credit great achievements, ranging from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to Iraq's departure from our army, to the end of the attack and to the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, among other things.
But, having repeatedly defended the Obama administration to my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the brink of political despair.
The Republican obstructionism cannot explain how foreign leaders are being listened to, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of the United States, nor the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal the government's misdeeds.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and the excess of spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the findings of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been the most aggressive of the attacks... since Nixon's administration.
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Care Act has been ratified.
I do not know whether that is what I was expecting.
If, at 18 years, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns preceding it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the massacre of Newton, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That is what disturbs me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or his positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by freeing himself from pressure from future elections, would keep the promises that have been talked about for so long.
Yet, while the favourable opinion index fell below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
I am not happy with the many promises that have been made.
This week I read the part of the book which describes how Obama has suffered enormous losses for Clinton in the Pennsylvania Mayors.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they had to return to the right track and remain faithful to their cause.
In the light of this, I would like us to focus on our talent, he said.
We must remember who we are.
Here we are, five years on, Mr President, and I am no longer in agreement with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, at 3 p.m., there was a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place from Retinne to Flero.
The moth, Jonathan, 26-year-old Flero, was not wearing helmets.
Despite the rapid relief effort, he died in this head-on collision.
Clive Palmer says that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system.
The billionaire Member Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, who contests the payment of a $6-million carbon tax, has put forward this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a possible conflict.
The Palace United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which might be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interests and indicated that Mr Abbott's daughters were prepared to benefit personally from these policies.
It will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because, if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she or she will not be given a free time leave, said Mr Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Election Commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast in Fairfax by 53 votes after recount.
Mr Palmer put forward the idea of revising the voting body to speed up the process.
Girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
We need a better system in the form of a better system, he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, seize your details in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6.30 a.m tomorrow morning?
Mr Palmer has also criticised the use of paper pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it to be possible to erase the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission examined the possible options with regard to electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59 years on, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions as seriously as possible.
The exercise of public service is a question of public service.
We are not looking for rewards, except for the reward of history, because we have to serve the community at a critical time, he added.
A biologist team led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new brew of dolphins off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Boverbers, who is responsible for the Centre for Conservation and the Study of Animals and Mililes Marins (OCEAMM), comes back to Express on the discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Is it any wonder that this new species of dolphin has been discovered?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
While species have in the past been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics enable us to improve our knowledge of species classification in science.
Moreover, it is not impossible for this progress to be made in genetic engineering and molecular biology to call into question the classification or membership of a species, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, morphologists ranked animals, based on morpho differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being called into question because of genetic advances.
In the same way, two very close species have been distinguished by genetic engineering.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this sub-family: the dolphins in the Pacific and the bullets in the Atlantic.
The recent analysis has made it possible to distinguish between four species.
Why is it an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society said?
From a conservation point of view it is essential to know about these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that they were part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if there were a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture in the region, we might end up with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a more widely-spread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
One species is considered to be under threat or endangered according to the number of individuals existing on Earth, that is to say of the stock, and of the opportunity to recover from neighbouring stocks.
As far as the species of Sousa chinensis is concerned, where the population of the new species is discovered, its stock is automatically lower, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals.
This combination of genes restricts the creation of new species.
On the contrary, closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can ultimately lead to the creation of new species.
We must be aware that the marine environment is the worst-known environment.
Instead, we prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what is happening in the liver of the Mariana Islands, just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is being spent on life-seeking life on other planets than on marine research and it is high time this changed.
RBS suspended two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency-exchange division from two sources close to the case, showing once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of currency-market manipulation is beginning to pay off.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of the most important financial market surveys in the world, where $5.3 trillion dollars change hands every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the course of the wider investigation that echoes the Libor interbank manipulation scandal.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from the regulators.
The ongoing investigation into this case is continuing and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and the other regulators, said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file stated that RBS had sent with emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European head of cash-trading for the currencies of JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of the exchange trading officer at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, trader senior currencies in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been subject to any accusations.
Mr Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that she had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said that he was investigating suspicions of currency-market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities in the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the United States Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority are investigating allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate exchange rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, have indicated sources close to the case.
Banks are issuing instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these surveys shook traders into a sector that has been one of the major drivers of growth in investment banks' trading units in recent years, but has been called into question this year because of the low currency volatility that is limiting the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the issue by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast, highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders argue that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that, despite the high volume of daily exchange-rate transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal trading platforms explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at very low prices.
The news arrived on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that he had sent away a trader working in his office for the London Stock Exchange this week after a loss of $6 billion at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the affair has been controlled by the courts, has indicated a representative of the Cr√©dit Switzerland.
The investigation into the Mayor Rob Ford has been cobbled together and is supporting a lawyer.
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video which would show Rob Ford smog from the crack, Me Clayton Ruby has never seen such a botched "survey."
Me Ruby said of the Canadian Press that the police had 'ignored or played down' the proof against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested the friend and occasional driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged 35 and accused him of extortion from video.
Alexander Lisi, who was previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said that they had also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby described it as' inexplicable 'the fact that the police have never searched Rob Ford's car or his home, or tapped his telephone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
According to the law, the police, having witnessed suspect transactions in their own hands, could well have intercepted the Rob Ford vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a mandate.
It could also have demanded a instant search of the search, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman, Mark Pugash, described Me Ruby as' a clear and desperate attempt 'to make his case to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute 'reasonable grounds' which could lead to a criminal accusation being made against the mayor.
Europe's Loss in mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, Europe's major stock markets are falling in mid-session on Fridays, cast by some of the disappointing new companies, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious that the US Federal Reserve could unlock its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
By contrast, after an inflation target of 0.7% for the eurozone as a whole, the idea spreads among the market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) might loosen its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street foreshadows a surge in America's actions after two consecutive rounds of retreat.
To the values, Renault (-4.63%) has recorded the sharpest withdrawal from CAC 40, which has been overshadowed by the warning about the outcome of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, having also published falling results this morning and announced the internal creation of a 'bad bank' structure of GBP 38 billion of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (up 2.45%) is sticking to the hikes of the EuroFirst300 in response to a press news that AT & T studies a possible takeover bid.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is going ahead, as John Hardy, the strategist of Saxo Bank, testifies.
The ECB's unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We are anticipating a great potential for a fall in the euro.
In this context, the euro is continuing to fall in response to the American currency and has, in the last two weeks, reached an all-time low of $1.3517.
On the other hand, such conjectures support the eurozone's bond market.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's health-care reform law.
A great victory for the Obama administration: the American Supreme Court said today that Obama's health-care reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges approved the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the law on the protection of sufferers and affordable care) that requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, on pain of having to pay a fine and said that it was constitutional in accordance with the government's power of taxation.
The Chief Justice, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the remaining sections of the 2,700-page bill and, moreover, ruled that the provision of the health-system reform law, which states that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid must be lowered or that all federal financing of the program will be mandatory in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Forum of Independent Business.
All the leading Republican presidential candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including the nominee Mitt Romney, fought fiercely against the law.
Remembering the Old Fighters in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the dead of all wars this Friday afternoon.
Lresses have been lodged in two of the three military carpets of the cemetery by Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Breaking between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed, and five Israeli soldiers were wounded on Thursday 31 October 2013 in a violent border-crossing on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory over the last year.
The only power station in the Gaza Strip has ceased to function on Friday 1 November after its fuel has run out, announced the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigade, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another Hamas army, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a firing of tank shells at an Israeli army incursion to the east of Khan Youn√®s, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the al-Qassam Brigade, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, died when an Israeli helicopter opened fire to the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters led a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An Attack on a Palestinian-led tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and a bulldozer bulldozed had an inch of 100 metres inside the territory and then withdrawn.
The conflict lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a press release, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and said that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation.
Hamas commends the heroes of al-Qassam who fell into defending the territory in an occupier's incursion into Khan Youn√®s.
Several enemies have been killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," has threatened the spokesman.
For its part, the Israeli army has indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large-scale tunnel that has been operating in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and, according to the army, for 'terrorist activities'.
Hamas has demanded the use of tunnels to fight Israel, specifying that the aim was to kidnap Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqu√©.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive device targeting the Israeli army forces and wounded 5 soldiers during the operation.
Israel's Attack in Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the danger of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," indicated the army spokesman Peter Lerner.
Moreover, Israel has struck a military base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles aimed at Lebanon's Shiite movement, reported on Thursday 31 October the Al-Arabiya satellite station.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike," but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were rockets transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Weighing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi-owned capital station has indicated that "The bombing has targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon ', with reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions on the coast of Syria on the Syrian coast on Wednesday at the dawn of a defense base at Sonar Jabl√©, near Lattaqui√©, on the Syrian coast.
This organisation based on a network of activists and medical sources was unable to identify the source of the explosions.
Black to black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents Danse's two new group choreographs: Henri Michaux's first tipping and poems, the second-movie with Satie's famous solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
It is an evening that makes it possible to see the whole lens of Chouinard, art and white ink black.
A white screen serves as a wall of substance.
On the carpets, white as it is, in the great space of the theatre, the theatre is ahead, profile, end like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a pink of Henri Michaux is thrown away.
The body, simple, takes its form.
And that form will be the shape of the whole thing: a certain amount of physical imitation of drawings.
The dancers, dressed in black clothes, hands and faces alone, wait on both sides of the playground, rush to the point when the next graph appears, incarnate, emerge from it.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made up of solos, in a united group (a solo mass), in the great group of twelve solos in which everyone carries out their sign.
We are thinking of 'Gloire in the morning', where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of oregraps written on cartels, set up online.
It is the same principle, PowerPoint giant.
Here, music is strong, priceless, and guitomic.
Energy is high, the pace is still fast.
There will be a split when Carol Prieur takes refuge under dance, to hand over, by hand, without any sobriety or restraint, one part of the poem of Michaux, monocorde and monotone in the cries, and will continue to dance.
And the music to get back, and the sequence to resume.
This long-winded and energetic discharge, if possible, ends up drying up and catching up.
So is the regularity of the visual rhythm as well.
There are some nice flashpoints - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - like the hair that flounds or the black tissues that stretch the lines.
But the choreographical approach is short-lived.
There is the impression that, instead of going to meet the work of Michles, the slip of the storm is being imposed.
As a result, the bodies seem flat before drawings.
Miching, like the forms of Gestalt, opens up a larger and more gifted imagination than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers hushed by strokes and white signals in a theatre that is suddenly black, is a magic exercise.
The public liked it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the entrance, is richer.
The game is partly frayed with grey, dancers and piano are covered in tissues, like furniture in a neglected house.
In the piano, dancers relayed to play a one-sided game.
Their abuse of music and its coughs of music give true fragility.
On the stage, they pass on couples, in delightful, very sensual, even erotic.
The work of a group, a small number of transitions, a set that moves, shocking, writing, is less binary.
There are buffoons, familiar to Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in very polarized, male-female parades.
The ovens are bloody, easy-to-do or players.
The sign, the laughter and the little cries and shouts occasionally transpose the archaic, the pardon and the ridicule of the bodies in cooking, who are based.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes into play when the public leaves.
All of this becomes possible: the fourth wall falls, the uniways are overlapping, the dabotaged dance, descending onto the spectators, glossing, smoking, running short, playing applause codes, stretching the sauce into a mess that is stunningly calculated and remains sensual.
Joy and madness are pirating, and it is the art of Chouinard here to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to criminal proceedings in respect of the Nordic patent
The group with thousands of former patents in Nortel has set up an avalanche of legal proceedings in respect of patents against cell-based telephone manufacturers, notably Google, the company it has coified at the time of the patent auction that took place after the Nortel collapse.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 million, lodged a complaint against Samsung Electronic Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other patent-infringement companies at the United States-based Court of Tasses in Texas.
Rockstar is held jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson, and Sony.
Google is accused of having violated seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that make it possible to advertise in connection with terms of research on the Internet have indicated the findings of the trial, which is the job of Google.
It was not possible to join Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones operating under the Google Android system, which is fiercely competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 per patent in Nortel.
Google has increased its supply several times, and finally proposed $4.4 million.
Having lost its Norkstar patent in Rockstar, Google later acquired Motorola for an amount of $12.5 Md, a market based partly on the Motorola patent library.
While it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auction, Google violated and continues to violate the so-called patent, have indicated the results of the trial.
Rockstar claims that Google, according to the plaintiff, claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the plaintiff.
Exploitation of a house in Gesves: defective water heaters cause the explosion.
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette on a gas leak.
The explosion in a town in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and his five-year-old grandson, was caused by a gas leak from a defective water station, indicated on Friday evening that the King for the King's office was shown.
The expert who was sent to the area by the public prosecutor ensures that the cause of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a leak and an accumulation of gas.
The vital prognosis of both victims remains committed.
The grandmother was thrown into the explosion and was seriously burnt down.
The little boy, who was in his grandfather and his girlfriend, was on his side and was burned slightly more.
"The two victims were intuitively and long conditioned on the ground before being carried away to the Li√®ge CHU, by helicopter, by ambulance, said the burgomaster Jos√© Paulet, who went to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Hand on, he was able to join the ground floor with the stairway left intact while the backlog of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenants of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, have been housed by the chairman of the CPAS.
The fire-fighters of Andenne and Namur and the police in the Arches spoke.
The civil protection of Crisborn has stabilised both buildings.
Egypt's First-Speaker President to Oath
Mohamed Morsi sworn the inauguration, but he is unlikely to see his day's triumph mark the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a new Egypt, when he took the sworn-in inauguration of the presidency, thus becoming the first president who was freely elected and President Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth-largest leader since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore to the 18 Judge Judge of the Court, whose Nile Building was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
We hope for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic, declared President Morsi during the formal ceremony on public television that was broadcast live.
Today, Egypt's people have laid the foundations for a new life which will bring about complete freedom, genuine democracy and stability, has explained to Mr Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been considered to be an illegal organisation and was severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen kept the building when Mr Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m, on a local day, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred fans had come to the Court to cheer the new president and, departing from the presidential boss of the Mubarak years, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow him to pass through the busy streets travelling from the town to the suburbs of the south.
Viewed as the Muslim Brotherhood's uncharismatic "pan-charismatic" bricks, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to portray himself not only as a candidate for Islamists, but for all those who want to finish work during the 2011 uprising against Mubarak's authoritarian president.
Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state, and Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, spoke to the judges in his boorish hall where he was sworn in.
Later, Morsi went to the University of Cairo, where he delivered his inaugural speech.
It was officially welcomed by a military fanfare that played the national anthem while at the time he was at your guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui was present at the ceremony.
When he arrived he was greeted by the community and army, hand-in-hand... from thousands of people in the University's great classroom.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a leader of Islamist student groups in the 1970 "s.
Morsi made a symbolic oath on Tahrir Square, where was the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year, and vowed to recover the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the old ousted president, took it away.
But by agreeing to lend officially to the Court, rather than to Parliament as it is customary, it bows down before the army's will by showing that the power struggle is not over.
Morsi's speech about Tahrir Square was accompanied by dramatic populist gestures.
The Shuttle in the US has slowed down the rise in the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most of the federal authorities was put on the growth in car sales in the United States in October, showing the numbers published by manufacturers on Friday, with five of the six leading to lower than expected performance.
Detroit's three big builders show double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts averaged 15.4 million in annualized and adjusted rents, but the market was set at 15.3 million, according to Adam Jonas's analyst, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the bank's clients, he believes that this slight brake is due first and foremost to the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first half of the month '.
Still, GM has reported an increase of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their trade performance improve relative to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to enjoy the success of its' pick-up ', has seen its sales increase by 14% in one year to 191 985 vehicles, whereas the consensus awaited 194 301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, has announced an 11% increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to the expected 143 536.
Toyota and Nissan also have lower sales to the consensus, despite increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM's was 1.4% at 16.35 GMT, while Ford dropped 1.1%.
Renault's Love Lessons for Nissan
On Friday, Renault's biggest drop in the SBF 120 index after its Nissan Motor announced that it had cut almost 20% of its annual net earnings, report traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced an overhaul of its direction.
Several traders have reported that the action by Renault was affected this morning by the 'early'.
"This is clearly Nissan's" clear profit, "says one who is responsible for the trading of a Paris broker.

Greece: Two Deaths in a shootings of a neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday evening with shots fired by two people on a motorcycle in a town of the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn in the western suburbs of Athens, learned from police sources.
The police were not in a position at present to give information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Golden Dawn members had argued that the victims were guards from their local offices.
The injured person was promptly hospitalised according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorism service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of the suburb of the suburb of the suburb of N√©o Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the area.
The incident comes weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MEPs, including the party's chief and founder, for participation in a "criminal organization" in an attack against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
The Appeal Brown Appeal
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two matches of the Champions of its club, against the Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against Bar√ßa for addressing a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment has had its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.

The great Montreal region is also experiencing its outages, with nearly 7,000 private households in the metropolis and in Laval.
Do you think that travel agents belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
Society has increased its forecasts of net benefit and is hoping for record results thanks to holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit on the whole exercise between $325 and $340 before tax, against a previous prediction of $305-315 M.
If current forecasts are achieved, this will mean 12-17% growth, compared to the record $290.4 ($1) achieved in 2011-12.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had made 8% profit in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had been started off, particularly with regard to travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are cost-effective, and several of them are well on their way to achieving record results on the whole exercise before the deduction of interest and tax revenue, he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries with the greatest profits.
In Australia, the leisure-travel industry rebounded in the second half of the year, which helped to compensate for a domestic market for small-scale business travel.
Similarly in the UK, the Flight Centre entertainment industry has performed well while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States has recovered its losses in the first half of the year, when the demand for a seasonal period is lower and was expected to benefit the whole budget for the third consecutive period.
The Flight Centre's actions increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people are pulling into a hotel near the Cairo pyramid.
Uncovered strangers opened the fire on a hotel near the Cairo pyramid in Egypt on Friday, with no victims, as a result of some apparent quarrel with laid-off employees.
The attackers fled, said the interior ministry's spokesman, the police chief Abdel Latif.
The attack is taking place at a time when Egypt has received virtually no tourists since the military dismissed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodballed his supporters "demonstrations.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthographer, and grammar
During the English literature course, students will have to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to our days.
The review will also provide for new, new-based legislation in order to encourage more diversified reading.
A combination of literature and English language will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, pupils will have to change from an independent GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Education Ministry must publish its new English and maths programmes tomorrow as the first areas for radical revision.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
What is more, Ofqual, the Board of Investigations, is going to uncover a revision of the structure of the GCG, with a new rating system and with fewer courses.
In the course of the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a broad consensus on the need to reform our system of reviews in order to restore public trust in the field, insisting on the fact that the GCSE would be more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, with the students of Singapore doing about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the use of time to maths, coalition government sources have indicated that the GCSE's GCHths have shown that the higher priority given to material in international rankings is likely to make schools work more quickly.
The programme will focus more on the real-world problems of the real world, especially financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in this state in July and broadly challenging the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
One Child hosting children with one gun to the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged between 9 and 13 years of age sat on the door to demand sweets on the evening of Halloween.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door with a shotgun.
The old man, aged 86, explained to the police that he had been afraid.
His weapon has been seized.
The ex-Chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
M√ºller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
M√ºller did not survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he secured a great deal of headlines every day on the basis of archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would be a response to one of the great conundrums of the post-war period.
The German secret services, the SNB, ensured that, during the summer of 1949, M√ºller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were completely wrong.
"As early as August 1945, the body of M√ºller was found in a provisional grave near the former Foreign Minister of Reich by a commando," according to Mr Tuchel.
He was' a uniform general '.
"In the domestic left-wing areas, among others, were his state of service with a photograph," he went on.
There is also the publication of a document from the town hall in Mitte in Berlin that it has been buried in the Jewish cemetery in the area.
The president of Germany's Central Jewish Council, Dieter Graumann, has been shocked by this revelation.
The fact that one of the most brutal Nazi sadists will be buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormous taste of disgust.
"The memory of the victims has been trotted out in the paper, with a heavy toll on the memory of the victims.
Heinrich M√ºller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been caught.
It participated in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the 'final solution' and, in particular, issued Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible for the 'logistics' of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr Georges Bwelle is providing free health care in Cameroon's villages
Dr Bwelle and his team are spending almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile apparatus
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of 2013's 10 Neros CNN.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, for the election of the 'CNN CNN' in the year before us.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked after his sick father alternating his sick periods of conscience and recklessness and went to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaound√©, Cameroon's capital.
Initially, he had only one arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a haematomas that he would carry the remainder of his life.
By contrast, there were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon's Cameroon, said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken it away if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in clinics and overcrowded hospitals to get any treatment he could get.
This is not an easy task, as Mr Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and you can rush to hospital in order to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctors per 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organisation.
By way of comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 inhabitants.
Even if they could see a doctor, many of them could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country's health costs are made in the private sector.
By contrast, the only problem they have is the poverty-based poverty, has explained Dr Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
Having seen his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out more than 700 such surgical acts free of charge over the past year.
He has become a doctor himself, working as a circular surgeon at the Yaound√© central hospital.
And he has set up a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas for weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32 000 people.
Almost every Friday, with thirty or so people, they are crashing themselves into vans after laying the medical equipment on the roof and going through difficult land to go to the villages that need the most help.
The chance does not always follow.
They have often had to drive vehicles to cross rivers or mud tracks.
But when they arrive they are received as heroes: the community organizes a festival, song and dance and provides them with the best available housing.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle is smiling with his great smile, and his overflowing energy is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team is beginning to receive hundreds of patients.
We have 500 people on every occasion of the world, said Mr Bwelle.
They sometimes live within 60 km of the village, and they are coming in.
In this travelling hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually-transmitted diseases.
Others can receive tents, a pair of glasses collected or a free-for-all certificate needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
Tonight, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anaesthetic.
Operations are usually carried out in a school, a town hall or a house; after the speech, the patient rises and goes into the awakening room and leave his place in the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrogen Group, the operating room and sterilization of the hardware, Dr Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours on Sunday morning.
This is a tiresome rhythm, but village musicians usually help the team to stay behind.
I am afraid you are knocking on drums all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work in accordance with one another, explained Mr Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returned to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroon doctors and medical students, carried out 700 operating operations free of charge over the last year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference to those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had suffered to cure a herd would enable him to work again.
This will change my future and that of my family, the man said.
In addition to providing a mobile hospital and working as a surgeon in hospital, Bwelle is also working the night in private medical firms around Yaound√©.
It is this second job, he explains, who finances 60% of their association; the rest is covered by private donations.
In the second year of the University of Drexel in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr Bwelle, a medical student in the second year of the University of Drexel in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr Bwelle's group.
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katye O' Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwelle in his missions is an opportunity for learning on the ground that they do not have at home.
It has been possible to take part in operations to help in empowering the blood or passing on the instruments to Dr Bwelle Direcs, explained Miss O' Malley.
It is not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying in medicine in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay for their journey to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical equipment.
But, once in Yaound√©, their pensions, transport and education are taken care of by Bwelle Doctor.
Wrong is a hero, and there is no doubt about it, said that it was Ka Malley.
He gives his life to this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not close to the ground.
Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload, is no problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that gives him great joy.
I am very pleased when I am doing this work, and Mr Bwelle added it.
And I am thinking of my father.
I hope he sees what I am doing.
To make people laugh and to relieve pain are the reasons why I am doing this.

The Two France of Pierre Nora
Lack, academics have long been struggling to define and place Peter Nora.
Professor in the amphiatres and the classrooms?
Perhaps, but by pointing out its weakness to the roads, Sciences-Po, the Haudes Eays.
Do we have any doubts about the works of others in their office in the Gaston-Gallimard street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the unwritten writing of the editor.
Who was the person who was Fontenelle at the French Academy?
True, but in the knowledge that such a coronation cannot replace true holy oil, that of the thesis that has taken place.
They were happy to recognise in him a great awake, facilitator and federator of their work, but they observed that he was unwilling to do so himself.
The monument to this unfathomable image is the monument to the "Memory Live," to which he committed his name.
Language missongants have been able to see this as a giant giant market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a lively eye and with erudition, but obviously amateurish.
The two books published by Nora two years ago have already established that he who wrote in order not to write had much and well written.
The book that is before us should finally do it justice.
Yet, again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagage, the jubilation that has been laid to one side by another.
But it soon becomes clear that the motley artifacts gathered in this book with such a nice title bring the crushing of the French identity to the rotten.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: it is a concern of the time.
Recently, we were collectively invited to give it a definition.
But, in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, French identity was timeless.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the Jacobinism case was left to prefects and sub-prefects, authorised interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is like is quite different.
It does not look like the heir to an eternal French, he is not in the definition.
He is an anxious Analyst with a familiar stranglehold, wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of reaches, plagued by irritating issues.
This one, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so long established within its borders, if formerly charities and solid masterpieces, are these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, only to avoid the disorder caused by the discord in French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguols, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
The most symbolic aspect, of course, is that of the two-fold history of national history.
After the revolution's earthquake, the French have two histories, and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second meant the death of the first, but did not want to deny it; instead, it wanted to restore its sanctity and the indivisibility of unity and indivisibility that she had cut her head at the person who was the clear and powerful incarnation of it.
And, from here, an invincibly binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration, and hatred of the revolution.
In order to make this unique feature of French identity felt, nothing is worth the four steps away from the Hexaggerone, so that Peter Nora's American stride might well be at the heart of his book.
Because America and France have both carried out a revolution, drafted a Declaration of Rights, wanted to create a new society.
But the American disembodied only serves to underscore what is unique to us.
There, men who had let their Ancien R√©gime in England and had no time to care about it.
Here, congested men from an indigenous Ancien R√©gime, and who are even more radical.
This is a consensual revolution when it has spread the drama and gave it to it.
These are the founding fathers who are still honoured, and here revolutionary ancestors are struggling to make models, and who have, moreover, killed each other.
This is institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to be made and trials to be carried out.
The France that Gents to France
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could cast the pink of their story apart, and overcome the number-two curse curse.
At that Third Republic, as a central and creative man, Pierre Nora has shown a great deal of interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then set about healing the revolutionary divide, teaching schoolchildren everything that was in the former France in a way that gave a dark picture of modern France and proposing a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has had only a time.
Here we are again in a debate, led by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of resale minorities, absorbed into the European area.
So the book provides both France's fascinating portrait, and France's cautious outline.
With it, the histories of the historian should contain a few surprises.
It says that the river is a state-of-the-art structure.
The man of multiple curiosities was, somewhat obsessively, based on the same idea.
The army of slurry was at the centre of the centre.
And anyone who, more than half a century ago, had a subject on the idea of a nation, but it was subservient to the original exercise of the thesis, we gave it, and cum grano salis, that he ended up doing it.
Of course, it is less rapacious, more strident, and more subtle.
But let us make no mistake about it, however.
This is because much more than the figure imposed by the university curriculum, it says the internal necessity of life.
A former hostage to Lebanon: "Return is fairly complex to manage."
Launching in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team from "Antenne 2" leaked a demonstration by Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
He was back in 2004 and participated in the creation of the hostage-trading organisation of the world, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for the hostages to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
The four Aqmi hostages (al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Peter Legrand and Marc F√©ret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in the Val-Thanks on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to return to their families.
And try, little by little, to take over the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normanin, 62, who had been a big reporter since 2008, retreated from 2008 as the president of the "World takeover."
As early as the evening of your release, you were sitting on the 20h of 'Antenne 2'.
What are your memories of your release today?
In Beirut, for example.
When I am released, I find myself in the boot of a car where I meet - without seeing him because he is black - Roger Auque.
He says' we are freed ', but I am not sure, and I say that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tenuous too.
It is war, and those who drive us are also very tenuous.
They are knocking on the edge of a pavement.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then there is the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
The French are bringing us to the French embassy.
It is the time for the first telephone calls, the relatives, the family, the friends and the press.
I remember having taken a bath for an hour.
And having drunk in the T-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night discussing with Roger and Marchiani.
Tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate into the airport at Larnaca in Cyprus.
At a helicopter there, you take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We are landed in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It is a bit brutal.
There is an incredible shake-up.
And a lot of the media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I am coming back and it is full of them.
The descent from the stairway of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin leads.
Bad men scrape at me to take photos and follow me to where I have to do some police to stop some of them from rising.
There is enormous media pressure.
It goes on and on, we are well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see it clearly.
We are coming out of a hole and we are suddenly in the media.
It is a bit complicated, a bit violent and quite complex to manage.
But the hardest has been done.
On the evening I am in 20h, and the next day I am on the television.
Let us then embark on a kind of readjustment to life, very slowly, for one or two months, which are rather like holidays.
How have the medical check gone and the debriefing DGSE?
I had a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in the Val-de-Thanks on the following days: radios, examinations of all kinds and a psychiatrist.
It is not a sitting that is doing everything, but we know that we can rely on it, remind it if we need it, that we are not left to our own devices.
That is part of the procedure.
I have also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage takers.
It was logical.
It did not bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages of Niger?
I am listening to what is being said.
The debate on ransoms, in particular.
I am annoyed about some things, some less.
I am trying to put myself in the dark about my past as a hostage, and my hat as chairman of the 'Otages of the World' association, which allows me to put a stop, and I think it is much more interesting.
I am wondering, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, together with others, for recognising the legal status of hostage.
In my view, there is a problem of semantics.
We must describe the hostage-taking hostage as' political '- which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Now, once again, everyone is in sympathy, in emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A tribunal in The Hague is doing just that.
Why do we not say to the hostage-takers, 'you have made a mockery of the rules of war, such as those in all the Geneva Conventions?
However, it seems to me to be legitimate, legitimate and to the point of common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocks me.
This is my main struggle.
Egypt's Islamists On the streets to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger is rising among Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of President Mohamed Morsi was opened, they took to the streets.
It is a mobilisation throughout Egypt to call for the reinstatement of the country's first democratically elected president.
It is not a trial that highlights the Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to make a copy of the documents in the case.
It is not a trial, it is a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial against a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to pass Sisi's sentence, not the other way round.
Morsi must judge Sisi on the massacres in Rlowering, the massacres in Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
From the clashes in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20 000 policemen will be deployed at the police college in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel complains that 9 US states are violating homosexual rights
Ever since the federal state recognised same-sex marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to an identity card for the Department of Defense and what comes with it, has reminded the Minister in New York in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League for Anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue such cards to the same sex in the facilities of the 'National Guard' based on their territory, he criticised, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social services or health services provided on these bases, or have access to their shops.
The Secretary of Defense said that he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that the federal law is implemented.
The nine-state frontal began with Texas, which is refusing to implement these services on the use of SGL settlements, owing to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
It was joined by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population involved in recognising same-sex marriage to around 5600 active people, 17 000 of them by including the National Guard, the reserve and the retired.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hybers
The sixth edition of Play Skateboard is taking place on Saturday 2 November in the ski skate in Hyers.
Organized by the SK8 unit of the Bump Association, competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Instenments are taken on the spot from 9 a.m on Saturday morning, and the qualifying stages will start within 10 a.m before the final time at 3 p.m. and the award of prices until 4 a.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people, some of whom are already attending the competitions at the highest level, along the lines of the young hyil Lorenzo Palumbo.
Just 10 years on, he has already won his place for the European championships in Copenhagen this year and he does not like anything as long as it could be used to show competitors that are larger than three.
The Mayor of Toronto is hunting journalists who have asked him about a drugs affair.
In Canada, the Mayor of Toronto is suspected of drowning, according to several media outlets.
These suspicions appear to be supported by a video handed over to the courts.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied that he has eaten the crack, while at the same time recognising that she has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday he hounded several journalists who questioned him from his property.
We also believe that sometimes the images do not need to be explained or commented.
A Cat Cale Surversion detected in the Val-d Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitchen in the Val-d Oise, clearly of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological inquiry was carried out to identify and care those who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October inclusive, 'specifies the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people with the kitten have already been identified," and received preventive treatment.
'For man, the preventive treatment of human rage, administered after contact with the bearer, but before the symptoms appear, is very effective, "says the communiqu√©.
The ministries are now calling on the persons who would have been battered, clubbed, bled away, or lashed up to a muse or skin at the kitten or whose animal has been in contact with the kitten between 8 and 28 October in contacting 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m and 6 p.m. from 1 November onwards.
"France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitchen or mother was imported from another ununtouched country," according to the communiqu√©.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last 'autochthonous' case of rabies which took place in December 1998 on a fox and that 'France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). "
A case of rabies on a whale illegally imported from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rabrage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," reminds ministries, and it can be transmitted for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama's Next Reformation of the Health System
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that if you are satisfied with your health-care regime, you can keep it that way.
After hundreds of thousands of people received notice of the termination of their service providers, the Republicans have criticised the president in the last few days, accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his promise of origin.
The vast majority of people with health insurance who suits them can keep it, he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he calls "a flurry in the news headlines about the resilience," President Obama urged the Americans to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-adapted health systems at the same price, if not more cheaply than was expected.
If you win, they will win, he said.
The Administration has announced that it should come as no surprise if the 5% of the population who take out their insurance are forced to change regimes because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
Please allow me to address these Americans directly: you deserve to be better versed, said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Mrs Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, has indicated that the launch in October of the online market had failed miserably.
I am also frustrated and irritated by the fact that anyone who is involved is added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who said this sentence when she believed his microphone was turned off, when she spoke to an assistant behind her at yesterday's sitting of the House after a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, the Missouri Republican representative, whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has repeatedly urged Mrs Sebelius why the dociable architect of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to sign up to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which now haunts millions of Americans.
Vetfall a special helmet at Abu Dhabi
The happy elected Jake Vite Prekop combined the color of the car mark with the German flag, while integrating speed and heat in the runway.
The German, Sebastian Vettel, quadruple champion of Formula 1, was truncated for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Prize on Friday, a special cascade whose design was carried out by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel was chosen by 1, 500 envoys from around the world, in a contest by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its stable force.
He was invited to follow the example of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion close to the runway and in his stand.
Vettel was to wear the Minutes on Friday and Saturday.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
One in Aubervilliers makes his Party's Party into the suburbs.
Let us make no mistake.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "suburb party" is directed not only at the suburbs.
I have chosen a French card as a logo, justifying it.
When I speak of suburban, I am addressing all those who are excluded from the big national family.
Despite this, its draft, presented on Thursday at a press conference in its home city of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to defend multiculturalism, the great cultural melting pot that characterises the neighborhoods.
My proposal 1 is to set up a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years of territorial attach√©, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even if it has not always been neutral.
Having, in 2002, stood by Jean-Pierre Chevenment, he then backed Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I am well aware that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are prepared to support me, I will listen to them as well.
It is only the extremist parties that I am talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune built his program - which was discussed on the Internet - from many of the issues that should be discussed to the inhabitants of suburban and, in particular, to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, legalization of cannabis, a 16-year civil majority, rehabilitation of the office of block-builder...
It now remains for candidates to make lists and to defend his ideas on the political stage. "For the 2014 municipal elections, it is likely to be fair."
It is a problem of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy, and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermusne already has seven head lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support letters that I have been receiving since yesterday are not all from the suburbs' look forward.
John Kerry has admitted, in an unprecedented way, that the American spying industry had gone too far in an inappropriate manner.
John Kerry has pointed to a reduction in America's defensive attitude to its surveillance programs by admitting, in an unprecedented fashion, that on several occasions, the spying espionage went too far in the wrong way.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, ruled on an automatic pilot when a series of incendiary revelations by the whistleblowers Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities.
The leaks have put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video connection, Kerry said: 'It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government knew some things in an automatic pilot because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and through the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, on 11 September.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American spying had overstepped the mark, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said that, in some cases, it went too far in the wrong way.
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now undertaking a thorough review of these practices so that nobody will feel they are being misled.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force for good, and that the NSA had saved many lives.
He went on to say: 'We live in a new world where people are prepared to blow themselves apart.
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding and people being murdered because we knew the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will visit Europe to address concerns over the alleged US spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, explained on Thursday the Chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken to Members of the European Parliament and others this week and he was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration felt by the monitoring of the National Security Agency.
It is truly important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans are standing shoulder to shoulder with each other in their mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the US Senate's Subcommittee on European Affairs in an interview from Washington.
And I will be going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some of the US allies, but the agency's director said this week that this is wrong and that it was a misunderstanding because it involved metadata which NATO allies had gathered and shared with the United States.
Other revelations have revealed documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and 34 other heads of state.
The director of the intelligence services, James Clapper, justified spying on allies by indicating that it was needed and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this stormy atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which should take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be disclosed in the days to come.
He indicated that the route remains to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this trip was to enable relations to be improved, but also to show a great deal of sensitivity.
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes that they themselves have been applying for years.
We can change our monitoring programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only people in the world who are involved in espionage, Murphy.
Meanwhile, Kerry plans to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the ill-will caused by American strategies in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, overshadowed by Shell's poor performance and the aftermath of an announcement by the Fed to maintain its economic support, as expected.
A Australian is using his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old lady in Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed and was denied bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket-style court on June 15, after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked her earlier on Sunday 10 June.
But video recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after being separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interviewed Bamford for two days before she admitted that she had invented the story of all parts.
It was held in a unit of the local police office before the hearing in court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention center in the Phuket periphery rather than in a women's prison.
It is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of Ruby Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the whole family was extremely concerned about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her to return to Australia.
We have, of course, had an agonizing moment, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible, said Tunks.
Bamford called the judgment and was set free after the payment of a 50 000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that, in the meantime, it was on holiday in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a Phuket local lawyer, but warned that the call could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
But, after Michelle Smith's recent murder in Phuket, an Australian trip, Thailand could also seek to restore its image from the damaged image of tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will stop the supporters of Anderlecht who came only with the buses of the RSCA
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeke, the spokesman for the Brussels-midday police area, Friday.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA, who will want to travel to this meeting of the Champions League, will be obliged to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border until the PSG stadium," the speaker passed.
The same will apply to the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that steps were taken to make arrests and even police arrests', Marie Verbeke has already announced.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school committee
In the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school committee, 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This was the reason, a year ago, for consultation with parents, pupils, teachers and members of education staff, in order to consider how we can better integrate the pupils who live between different cultures.
The school committee has just revealed its vision of 'Living together in French'.
For a year now, Vision diversity has been promoted in schools to help pupils of all origins discover common benchmarks which are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture and our location are milestones.
The great names of writers, artists, whether they are remembered or who they came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So, projects are being set up in such a way that they identify with everything," explains the chairperson of Vision diversity, A√Øda Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, has identified a number of challenges for the school committee.
"On the transmission, for example, of the culture that is quashed in Scotland, the feeling of belonging, the support for staff in the transformations that are being experienced, within the students', he said.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school committee has set up a research centre which will give tools to teachers who sometimes also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be its scientific director.
Preparation to run a class in a North American context, even quaint ecois.
"Different educational strategies are what is needed," she said.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: language, school, social and cultural.
