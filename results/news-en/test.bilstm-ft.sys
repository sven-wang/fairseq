Spectular leap in "wingen" above Bogota
The sportsman, Jhonathan Florz, slandered on Thursday of a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped of a wingen (a combination of help), he went to 160 km / h above the famous Monserrarte sanctuary, located more than 3 000 metres altitude, where many badaders had gathered to observe his feat.
A black box in your car?
While the planners of the US road network find it hard to find the money needed to repair the highway infrastructure, many people see a solution in the form of a small black box that sets itself above the board scoreboard of your car.
appliances, which record all the miles travelled by a driver and pass on information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the main American roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of major axes suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmentalist groups to press for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you park, and possibly on the road you circulate, then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while the members of Congress fail to reach agreement on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They look for how, over the next decade, they can switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system for an experimental vivid.
This is really essential for our nation.
It's not as if we had the choice, said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Goverdities, which provides that the state begins to record the miles travelled by every Californian driver by 2025.
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
Pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes that the Americans pay for the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as before.
Vehicles can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase taxes, even 1%, while the price of petrol is high.
The tax on petrol is simply not tenable, declared Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently installed traces on 500 cars to test a payment system.
This is proving to be the most logical alternative in the long term, he said.
Wonks call this the cost of use at mileage.
It's not surprising that the idea is seductive liberals, because taxes could be used to change driving habits so that we can reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California's planners are interested in the system because they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious laws on global warming.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the House of Representatives, said he considered it as the most viable alternative in the long term.
Opponents of the free market of the Reasa Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for it.
It's not just a tax that engages in a big black hole, said Adrian Moore, vice-president of politics at the Reasa Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they are given.
The movement is also supported by two former US secretaries in Transports who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go down the road to the mine payment.
The US Senate approved a pilot project of $90 m last year that would have been about 10 000 cars.
But the presidency of the House has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or city.
Several states and cities are nevertheless making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5 000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state charge of kilometric costs instead of taxes on petrol.
The Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York envisages one.
Illinois is trying to test a limited number of lorries.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the US coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is exploring how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In the Nevada, where about 50 voluntary motorists recently fitted their car with an appliance, drivers were worried that the government could follow their little facts and gestures.
The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem, said Alauddin Khan, who governs strategic management of performance at the Transfada Department.
It's not something that people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the Nevada's ACLU warned about its site: it would be relatively easy to transform these appliances into fully-fledged localisation devices.
There is no need to build a huge and congested technological infrastructure that will inevitably be enlarged to keep records of people's everyday lives and day-to-day lives.
The Nevada is one of the few states that now move to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles short a car, but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do this, added Kan, the citizens will be more comfortable.
Research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up of California on the name of Tue Mileage.
Originally, society didn't want to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
She sought to perish in the emerging market from self insurance, in which drivers would pay according to their kilometre.
But the devices she tested have planted planners of major axes because they don't use GPS and provide a limited quantity of information, periodically downloaded by mom.
People will be more inclined to do this if you don't register their speed and do not locate them, declared Ryan Morrison, the Director General of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of certain states.
There are much cheaper means and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try to experiment by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any apparatus at all, preferring instead instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing equipment to do more, rather than not enough.
In the city of New York, transport officials seek to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay for parking costs, provide insurance payments for driving and create a set of data on real time from the other drivers that motorists could use to avoid congestion.
The car drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them, a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate on the payment to mine is not just a huge dispersion.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission Commission of San Francisco, officials say that Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust by increasing taxes on gasoline.
A single annual or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of petrol, so everyone pays their fair share.
There is no need to resort to a radical surgery when you simply need aspirin. You said Mrs Rmentscher, the director of legislation and public affairs in the committee.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four news stories
The English musician has not ended up taking over this year.
From The Next Day, appeared in January, he concocted a luxury reedition scheduled for 4 November, with several news stories.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the appearance of a new album of David Bowie had left everyone out.
On the day of his 66th birthday, 8 January 2013, he said that a new album would come out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Realty, dates from 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that you could still count on him to divide the pop stage.
A festival for his fans
Not as a result of surprises, David Bowe had more in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has thus planned to rewrite this album on 4 November.
For the occasion he concocted a real festival for his fans.
This reedition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unusual session sessions and the remixs, as well as a DVD containing the four clicks already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional titles compared with the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specifically unveiled for the occasion, and two remnants.
David Boie has also made presentations of this beautiful coffin in a video.
It introduces both the discs, but also the accessories provided with: photos and exclusive shepherds, a net to share its own impressions, a revelation with words...
And, above all, he gives a foretaste of his new title Atomica, typically in the guy of The Next Day, with very advanced guides and rock-bottom electricity.
Innovations that are already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to disclose his weapons.
The Informing, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFOO, are also available on the web.
The Informing is twofold: a worrying trainer before a luminate cavalcade that is gradually slowing down to allow a pop bullout.
On Like A Rocket Man, he wanted to make a small reference to the Rocket Man Elton John, or even to Gavity?
With this title, the singer seems in any case to be in his point when he has no feet on the ground.
Spit Oddty, next, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFOO, David Boie again refers to his strangers: would he come from another planet?
The rifles of guerr guys are keen to leave the Earth.
Bowie is amusing at least to play camera with these titles: in turn, informally, man on the edge of a rocket, martial potential...
He conceals and reveals both, plays different personalities, as he did throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggle Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It's not surprising that he has a mask at hand in the photograph of the Campaign in the Vogage, the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from 10 November.
Defense Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and pointed out that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attached by liberals and neo-democrats in the House of Commons, Mr Nicholson assured you that before their release, the members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All the injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing the injured soldiers - who do not respond to the rule of "the universality of the service" of the army demanding that staff be able to carry out a series of different tasks - to reach the 10-year qualifying period required for pension benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse Canadians, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reservist, in Ontario, reached post-traumatic stress syndrome, has been released from the army despite his request to stay a year more so that he can receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirchester, who said in a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not answer the rule of universality of the service.
Mr Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was completely different than wanting to leave ranks.
"I told them that I was not ready", he said in a meeting with the Presse Canadian Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine which latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to stay in the ranks, but who are not fit for battle.
Under current rules, the soldiers seriously injured have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they can be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the service required to obtain pension benefits.
The liberal spokesperson on former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, asked on Wednesday the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while the neo-democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this disgraceful practice."
Disney put on the tablets to launch a lively series
The American media and entertainment group has decided to give priority to the tablets in its own television channels for the next phase of a new set for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Cally "WWild West will be available from 24 November on the website at the website. com or via its application for telephones and tablets.
Its global launch on the channels of the Disney group is planned only in 2014, details the communiqué of its Disney Junior division.
The lively cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the Chatete Cally, the sheriff of a city of the West American where it reigns the order with a magical laso.
Each episode comprises two stories of 11 minutes.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today", commented on Albert Cheng, Vice-President responsible for digital products at Disney / ABC Television Group, cited in the communiqué.
This kind of experiment comes within the framework of the efforts of Disney to "extend the life span of its series and build new relations with its public through digital platforms that are increasingly important", he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the less than 2 years old have already served a tank or phone, and 72% of the less than 8 years, compared respectively 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of US surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the whistleblowers of American intelligence, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the National Security Agency of the United States and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.
However, saying the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the US Government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the case of the complaint lodged by the US Department of Justice, he is accused of spying and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, said in Zeit Online: If Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German officials, we will make sure that we make that possible.
Relations between the United States and Germany were put to the test following complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Ophotn, the Member who heads the parliamentary group supervising the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness, without putting it at risk and completely ruining relations with the United States, we had to take advantage of it.
Mr Stöbele, a German Green MEP, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Stöbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testifies in Germany, he should be assured that he would be safe there, he said the Member.
Mr Snowden wrote in his letter that he was the subject of a serious and sustained persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to my act of political expression.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials, including in the United States, found that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public utility.
The letter puts forward a offer of cooperation with the German authorities when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.
Cogeco Câble could soon offer interactive TV.
The subscribers of Cogeco Câble could well have access to applications like Facebook, Twitter and finally the video service on request Netflix via their television in a future that does not seem so far away.
The subsidiary of Cogeco indicated on Thursday that it is currently carrying out preliminary tests of the Beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will enable us to develop more user-friendly interfaces and more options", explained the president and head of the management of Cogeco, Louis Audet, in the interview.
Cogeco Câble, in this way, does not suit his competitors, like Bell, even if the subsidiary of Cogeco does not yet have a precise date in relation to this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," emphasized Mr Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools to which our customers do not currently have access.
The telecoms giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussions with some major cables so that its service can be available via their broadcasting platforms.
The s.-d.g. de Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement by the Harper government during his speech of the Top, on 16 October last.
Ottawa wants to force TV providers by cable and satellite to offer customers the opportunity to pay services on the card.
"It's about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chains of chains, it doesn't work," said Mr Audet.
However, it hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) will result in interesting recommendations.
"It's to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," said the s.-d.g. de Cogeco.
The CRTC has been holding consultations with the public since last week and they should continue with industry next spring.
On the results, Cogeco indicated that it recorded a net benefit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 by action.
This is a retrograde step compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83, by action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline with the depreciation costs linked to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the cable, Atlanc Broadband, established in the United States in 2012, for 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition company after the company that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, Indian society also bought Peer 1 Network Enterprise, an Internet supplier established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
As for Cogeco revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the financial year under way.
The net benefit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90% by action, backward compared with the 45.7 million, or 93% by action, of the same period last year.
The income of Cogeco Câble, however, grew by 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers in Cogeco Câble is rising 5546.
Mr Audet does not worry about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, it's not the indication of a change of trend, he has observed.
It varies from one quarter to another with very fierce competition.
Horse in beef products
Meal meat has been found in canned beef products, sold by two small British school teachers at low prices, announced today the food hygiene agency.
Travelling tests have revealed that products, produced in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bingin and Quality Save channels, contain the DNA DNA to the tune of 1 to 5%.
"Since horses are not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the British agency.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked plants broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to examinations of the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products that are supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles took four wounded, early on Friday, on 131, in Lancet.
Shortly before 4, a motorist who moved in the north, in Saint-Félix-de-Vales, lost control of his vehicle and lost a car that came in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Movement had returned to normal to 6h, Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay the hand luggage
Frontier Airlines envisages paying up to $100 to passengers who carry hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in his announcement on Wednesday she indicated that passengers could take the unopen cane with them at the plane's descent.
The new costs of hand luggage concern the bags in the higher compartment, so the small bags installed under the siege will always be free.
Frontier said that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if travellers were paid only once at the boarding door.
Frontier spokesmen, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was planned to induce travellers to pay the costs in advance.
We don't want to make this price pay, she explained.
Airlines started to pay the first and second baggage recorded in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs were doing as much as they could in hand luggage in the top compartments, so there was often no place in these compartments.
These costs are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new costs will not really be used to collect money.
It is a question of making the customers of Frontier the most faithful that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the higher compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline's site will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger who queues at a boarding boarding door could carry a sack free, while the next person in the tail could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that the site and procedures for registering Frontier are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before arriving at the door.
The costs of hand luggage in Frontier will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often work on charges of luggage and other costs, but the airlines are adorning them.
They believe that the costs of handling luggage are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people in Wall Street regard the addition of luggage costs as a sign that airlines are paying quite expensive to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them did not hit the costs of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first costs of hand luggage three years ago, and the company low-cost Allegant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant with airlines Jy Sorensen, which closely follows the costs in addition.
He estimated, in a report of December 2011, that the costs of hand luggage in Spirit were 50 M dollars per year.
Sorensen, a former framework of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the boarding door at a time when passengers would discover the costs of luggage baggage imposed by the company.
I never saw an embarrassment procedure as fluid in all my professional career as he said.
I had expected to see teeth and a baggage knocking at the door.
The plane was full, he added, the passengers were on board at the speed of the clarity.
Frontier also makes like Spirit and apply $2 for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice can take the unopen channel with them, and those who take coffee can be served free.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to make it pay for drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after the passengers complained and when no other big airline had followed.
The Sortier decision to pay costs of hand luggage when passengers do not buy their ticket directly from the airline is his last effort to encourage clients to go to his website.
Airlines pay for online travellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she started to offer only half of all loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced the bonus premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a Frontier trip of 1 000 miles purchased with an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the site of Frontier.
Frontier has a faithful clientelist in his home town, Denver, but his activity is shrinking and it loses money.
The revenue fell by 9% and its flight capacity fell by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republika Holings Inc.
Republika Srpska tried to redress the finances of Frontier by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an internal error, not computer hackers for the breakdown of its site.
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said Friday that it was a bug that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours, not the hackers as some had claimed online.
NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening because of an internal mistake that took place during a planned update, indicated the spying agency in a declaration by email.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The allegations that the breakdown was due to an attack on service dissent (DSD) are false.
Earlier this evening, traces of online servers noted that the NSA site had been broken for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA indicated to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the agency was not at all a compromise.
No classified information is in danger, explained the spokesman.
At least a group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to inundate a target site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the targeted system.
The previously ultra secret NSA, a time overnamed the No Such Agency, has found itself under the spotlight and strongly criticised over recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programmes at national and abroad, which form part of the secret files of the NSA stolen at the agency and disclosed by the former disabated consultant of the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency caused a lot of speculation that this evening's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The hotel Delta Centre-Ville closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned it sold it to promoters who will transform it into student homes.
Three hundred and fifty people were working in the hotel.
Of them, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, we met individual employees to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional director of the work relationships of the Hôtel Delta, Felix Baine.
The closure of Delta intervenes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was the owner of this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue to operate, so there were investments of tens of millions while competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Or either he sold it to someone else, and it's what happened" explains Paul Arsenbault, the holder of the Transat Tourism Championship to the School of Sciences of UQAM management.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the next few months, like the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling almost 600 chambers will be born in two years.
For the CEO of Tian, "The purchase project of Goodyear Amiens starts with zero employee."
After burying the sponge in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site of Amiens promised for closure, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of American tyre Tian, is now declaring himself ready to save 333 jobs on 1137 of the plant.
Arnaud Monteburg, Minister for productive recovery, had already announced it, Monday 21 October.
Having renounced the plant's purchase plan in January, you are now returning.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers" who "work three hours" a day, "crazy" unions, in pursuit of the CGT.
We do not understand this U-turn.
Is it to please Mr Monteburg?
I don't try to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr Monteburg is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I am sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Is the truth boring you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries work eight hours handicap France.
In India, China and in other countries, we work 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has room for expansion.
Why does Tian so badly need this plant?
Tian doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a proper price and competent workers, it's worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good departure allowance, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now let us imagine that Tian buys in Goodyear the closed factory.
So Tian could move machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Monteburg knows this.
But he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Tian accepts recruiting them among the approximately 1 200 current employees of Goodyear.
So Mr Monteburg needs a commitment from Tian before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear pass an agreement on departure allowances for all employees.
So there will be no employees in the factory.
Mr Monteburg said that you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm this?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on departure allowances.
If all employees accept them, the factory's purchase project starts with zero employee.
How can we give guarantees of employment time when there are no employees on the site?
If Mr Monteburg succeeds in getting the CGT and Goodyear to agree and that Tian buys the factory, we intend to stay in Amiens-North more than four years.
The Bomber's profits fall, while the deliveries and orders of aeroplanes are declining.
Bomardia Inc, the Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% fall in its net benefit on Thursday, under pressure from a drop in orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trust division.
Bombarder, based in Montreal, did not provide any test data for his brand new CSeries plane or information about whether the plane will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial service before September next year.
After the inaugural flight of the trial plane about a month and a half ago, it only passed three times, and the question then asked whether the trial phase was on the right track.
The results did not match up to forecasts and the stock prices fell by 8% to the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst in the National Bank Bank, lowered his rating on Thursday, switching from overperformance to performance of the sector, owing to the low potential for stock exchange in the next quarter or two quarters.
Although the decline in deliveries of aircraft has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transsports division, which Cameron said on a note to customers.
We think that Bombardier will register new orders for his CSeries planes as the flight test program moves forward.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombre hopes that the family of CSeries will be able to cater for it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and took off for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is modest until now up to 177. It seems that potential buyers wait for the results of the tests in flight to validate claims from society regarding energy efficiency and the potential for savings of the new online plane.
At present, society has recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beautaire, president and head of the management, is convinced that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 firm orders before the commercial service of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured the analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the programme was advancing according to the timetable.
The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than planned, said Mr Beautaire at a telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and the software update were planned during the time of the plane.
Each manufacturer is planning differently.
We decided to take a first flight and to provide for a period of updating, and that is what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight programme.
The second of the five test aircraft should be flying in the next few weeks, the others will follow shortly afterwards, indicated society.
But analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries plane only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombader indicated that she was evaluating the timetable for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
This slowness of the flight tests, although it apparently complies with the internal timetable of Bomardier, reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015, Mr Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, the net benefit of Bomardier fell to $147 M, or 8 cents per action, compared to $172, or 9 cents per action, a year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The income has fallen slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 $m.
Analysts expected a result of 10 cents per action and income from $4.56 million, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / S / S.
The fourth aeronautical manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, against 57 a year earlier.
The net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautical division represented $32.9 million on 30 September, an unchanged figure compared to 31 December of the previous year.
In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing, as Mr Beautaire said.
Aeronautics's income has fallen by 13% to $2.
Bombard, the biggest railway manufacturer in the world, said that the income of this division had increased by almost 11% to 2.1 Md.
The chain of orders of the Transportation Division totaled $32.6 million to 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transportation Digital have suffered from implementing problems concerning a few big contracts.
Leaders have announced that new indications will be provided in the fourth quarter.
The course of the Bomardier shares, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of Google's financial management, would sit on the board of directors, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aeronautical manufacturer in the world and competitor closest to Bomardier, indicated on Thursday a 10% decline in its quarterly benefit.
Two spseologists of 23 and 27 years old were missing in a chasm under the Dent of Crobubbles since Thursday evening, we learned Friday at the Spéélio rescue from the Isle.
They were localised this Friday afternoon.
The two men, a prey to practice and the other no, were left on Thursday to 9.30 to make a crossing of the Dent de Crobubbles, located on the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartrous.
Then we had no news from them ever since, specified the same source.
"Spéléleologists should have appeared at around 5h of the morning," said Thierry Larrebe, a technical adviser to the rescue organisation.
Tens of people on the ground
Twenty dozen sectorists, ten members of the French rescue package, as well as the policemen, CRS and firefighters were there.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It's another group of speleologists who, after having found them exhausted but healthy in the courteousness, sent information to one of the rescue teams engaged in the network" explains the Dauphine.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of Chamkin Chambers of Chamberry have been found "exhausted but not injured."
They lost in the network, returned to their not waiting until the rescue, specified the prefecture.
Refuelled, they should come out of cavity with the help of the rescue workers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists "union invited its members to stop using online services of Google and Yahoo in the aftermath of new revelations about the activities of US and UK intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends to journalists to avoid a new order to use search engines and Google and Yahoo messaging," says it in a communiqué.
She considers "scandalous" information from Washington Post, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK's Headquarters Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) collected collections of information by infiltrating international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordination of their sources and the nature of their communications with them" added Michael Konken, the president of the trade union who claimed 38,000 adherents.
They painted: a Member asks for the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project by Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "Listing" of traffic lights in Brussels does not please everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Workers' Rights and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project of repainting 16 firetraffic lights from the region to the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "the identity of Brussels."
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels signalling lights, at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the blue-card chosen by the minister is "too big," according to the gentleman of Brussels Emmanuel De Bock who talks about the "flash" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"No content to spend money wisely on Brussels" money in reconnecting polling stations with the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of the Capital of Civille, "insurgency Mr De Bock in a communiqué.
After his yellow-manual-black taxi, she eventually repainted herself in black blue-blue yellow the poles of Brussels.
According to the honourable Member, there is now "no difference of visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels."
The Brussels laws deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD-V minister who itself carries out the NVA programme.
It's high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"To remind you, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2 245 votes to 0.5% of Brussels." It concludes Mr De Bock.
Pu-de-Buis's pork
The ecotax of Pez-de-Buis, around which Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax was held, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Grants arrived on the spot shortly after 10 hours, and circulation on the national side was hijacked in the crowd.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of the Finisterre on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, a pork manager.
This is the last of the three eco-tax portals operating in the department of the Finiser, the other two have been disillusioned or sabotaged.
Landing an accessory shop for Google Glass
A online shop, proposing multiple accessories to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of connected glasses signed Google.
They can acquire an ear, a charger or even an old adage.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, proposes a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
At the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective house manufactured in micro-fibre or an intractable ear.
Although Google is currently working on a model of Google Glass fitted with correction verges, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father got rid of the world of the living.
At the beginning I denied his death, I was talking about him now,
I was so afraid to forget it or, rather, I didn't know how I was going to continue to "attend."
There is no recipe, a way of working to pass the wall of invisibility and return to its own.
Then there are signs.
The first time it was the very strong feeling that he was present on the passenger seat when I was driving.
On another occasion, a dawn awakening in the middle of night to look at his show that leaves me no longer, put on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who accompanies me in my everyday life.
Our mother left after her fight exhausting cancer.
That's at least what I thought about the day when I found his empty body, crashed on this hospital bed to cheated flags.
Likewise, his funeral was an ice farewell focused around the little light of the channes that framed his coffin.
I thought she was part.
Little by little, by small, dim or night appearances, a bit timid, slightly erased, it quickly came back in my mind, evolving as it regained its place in the landscape of my thought that believed in mourning.
And then she showed herself to be telling me my own facets that I didn't see yet, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother, but just a woman whom I didn't know really, a woman who personified this person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfect her life and liberated the person I've liked, and here I've found it, full and full.
This deviation from my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that the loved ones never leave us.
I'm like my father, "on the devil and outside it" he was.
I have always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relations with him until he became old, sick.
Here I was no longer afraid of him and I was able to love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I had trouble...
He spoke, I was constantly encouraged, he lived my body.
I saw his hands by looking at mine, I was lending my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I was able to have a personal life.
He left me my intimacy.
It lasted for a long time and one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said that people who died are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer, but I'm constantly feeling them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? Who would they have thought? Are they doing?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not all the nights but several times a week is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always something that prevents me from doing this.
I often wake up anew when it arrives and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams strike me on the contrary and form part of my story and indeed they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my mastery where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamt that I woke up, I got out of the bed, my father was waiting for me on the banner and he smiled and rejoiced that I waited for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was happy with what happened to me.
And, of course, it was a little boy in my womb.
I liked to share this moment with him and I am happy to tell you this shared memory after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died as a result of cancer.
A year ago, she was travelling with my family in Cuba.
It's to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young banner that I was at the time.
Despite everything, I did my bit fairly quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially at times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to take important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a mouthpiece in a big school, have not been, with hindsight, anodyne choices.
In fact, I heard him often talk Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where it had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she accused me are still present, so I think I can think how she would like me to act at a given moment.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and the right spirit of the one that was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel like a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a salvator spirit.
I see his eyes on me.
My mother died ten-nine years ago now.
Morte after I spoke to the phone.
I have gone through all phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, the platitudes that start alone, anywhere, anywhere, in insolent places, incongruous moments.
Then, time calmed the penalty.
It's only the lack, this void without response, this need for it, to assign me, to reassure me at the crunch of its soft.
However, she is here, silent presence, she is there and I look at it.
Every morning, I see his eyes worried about me, I see the circles that add to his eyes, the rivals around the lips that are compounded by cigarettes, the bars that mark the front days.
My mother has taken possession of my face and I look every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn a blind eye.
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of a cancer to 43 years.
We constantly feel its protection, nothing serious can happen.
It's his promise on his bed of pain, so you're slowly learning to smile, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Well, I'm talking about it in the guy of night when the absence is doing too badly, it invites me in my dreams when morale is a bit.
We feel stretched and protected in difficult times, the decline in time makes us realise how much she was head of orchestra and we try to stay on the path she had outlined.
If you have loved a very strong one, the absence can get you out of the heart and memories.
In a way, loved it becomes your domestic energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I was not able to attend his inhumation and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a small boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his own, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I still wonder what he will think about it.
I don't know if I have adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: Is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It's a bit like an algo, there was no need to talk between us.
In short, it is there on a daily basis.
I feel her presence and that makes me happy.
It's almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I had 28 years and our son 6 years.
The immense punishment that then invaded me was, of course, mitigated, but it is always close to me.
Very often he "landed" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that the awakening I am even sadder to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he replied "I'll descend" but with such a real voice that I woke up in a hurry, anguish and lit the lamp of horse by watching everywhere, convinced that he was going to arrive.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I look back to see if he is not there, I know he and I'm talking about him.
In all parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or her spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I have always lived only since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I'm sociable with a job of responsibility, I'm standing and I'm chasing, I'm a grandmother, I have full friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I'm never going to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was in Iraq the most deadly month since April 2008.
Baghdad published the official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Prime Minister of Iraq is received by the US President.
Nourly al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't say to the world to be on our side and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," said Al-Maliki this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what happens in Iraq is not resolved, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? It spreads.
Nourly al-Maliki spoke to the Institute of the United States for peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, demonstrators protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were branding placards accusing him, among others, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with aid.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the Lord of the Crime Neil Scarrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would be revealed to the great day
He was sentenced to a three-year prison sentence by the Liverpool Court of Assurance
A great defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs was revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years ago, gave sensitive information to the Lord of the Crime Neil Scarrough on investigations into his activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was known as "Basah" and considered by criminals as a matter of prime importance, was arrested at home in 2011 following police interception operations directed at Scarborough, which he represented during a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officials have resumed Sarborough, 32 years, by tabling three bags of cocaine at the home of the lawyer in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while he was attending a dinner of Barreau with brothers.
Surveys have revealed that Ditta was a regular consumer of this class-based drugs after tests have shown traces of cocaine in his hair, his portfolio and his credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he sought to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the account of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in an important investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 m, as well as more than £200 000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to criminals because it feared that its drug addiction would be exposed to the light of day.
Today, at the courtyard of Liverpool, Ditta, who works in the cabinet of Forbes Solidarity lawyers located in Blackburn, has fallen into disrepute after being convicted of two charges of impediment to justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The fall of the lawyer came after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and returned to the home of Ditta and put drugs, pure to 60%, under the dustbin of the lawyer in a black golf gander.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the stadium at Ewood Park, the forum of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer has returned home, discovered drugs and they have telephoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a regular consumer of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drugs in his hair, his portfolio and his credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied to eat cocaine. He said he talked about the alleged drug trafficking because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a legal privilege.
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his portfolio and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and we received a sample of hair.
During an interrogation he said he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace and that he came to see clients call him for legal matters.
But the court heard testimonies that he called for major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators knew.
Public prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If someone should know that you don't have to violate the law, it's a criminal lawyer.
Mr Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular customers.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug trafficking, but a drug trafficking drug that provides drugs to its own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But it went well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He has obstructed the police investigation as much as he has been able to continue his criminal activities.
Mr Ditta did not honour his profession, but he dishonoured it.
He has been too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he has allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal disturbances and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I'm not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.
But after the hearing, the superlover Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has gone from a criminal lawyer to criminal himself when he started to get drugs from criminal organisations.
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the rethinking of the leaders of the organised criminal groups who have entrusted him with valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and create a climate of trust among the public.
Mr Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter behind the varnishes of his profession.
The unit responsible for serious and organised crime in Lancashire conducted the investigation on Mr Ditta, who was convicted of the three charges of possession of cocaine and now of hindrances to justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecute criminals in court.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and you will bring it before the courts.
Scarborough was himself imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity with heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in traffic have been sentenced to a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a Question / answers session on himself during which he said that his dream of dreams would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death corridor in America, his last guy at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what motivates him to work.

The classic adolescence for teenagers
Each time, it's the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had had a lot of success during the previous season.
Through five Saynets imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vignettes with a high dose of humour, we allow teenagers to apprise the classical sword.
In addition to this spectacle, the Kingdom of England's lyrical art company will return with its lyrical SUR, a formula that now closes the Pulperie of Chiapmi.
Two other concerts will take place in 2014, which gives artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities added the lyrical lyrical, the concert that was held last August, with the help of the sooano colourcature Marie-Eve Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organism to produce a financial balance that is as sweet in the ears as an air of hot-mouse.
Without giving specific figures, the Chairman of the Administrative Board, Yves BerGeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chiaptimidi to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is well, even in the long term.
We have more solid and consistent support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step that we will take in seven years", "commented on the administrator.
"I'll even go beyond", added the Directorate General, Hélène GaudRenault, by smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the school Gabrielle Roy of Surrey faces six charges, according to the royal Gendarmerie of Canada.
Omar Mustafa Hassan was accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening threats, wearing weapons in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reaction of the policemen involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately have been essential to the security conclusion of this incident", said Corporal Bert Péquet by means of communiqué.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to stand in court on Friday.
New request for collective redress against the Saint-Cross brothers
A new request for collective redress was lodged against the Saint-Cross brothers, on sexual assaults that would have taken place this time in the Saint-Joseph orgy and in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the petitioner, identified as "J. J." Who would have been masked in the 1950 "s, first to our Lady-de-Neiges by his professor the Sousted brother, then by his professor, Father Bernard, to the oratory Saint Joseph, where he was serving messiah and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when we announced the Rules of Procedure, many people told us: "I was in such a place, is I able to register?", tell the lawyer Alain Arsenult, who defends the victims in both cases.
The collective redress that has just been put forward is special to allow the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the Saint-Cross grouping.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints by 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Saint-Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first resort, since several of the institutions targeted closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stresses that the conforming of Saint-Cross and the oratory Saint Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", "that they've exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", "that they" knew about the sexual abuse carried out and have nonetheless stifled them "and that they" consciously and consciously chose to ignore the problem. "
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Saint-Cross brothers, Me Emile Perriin, in the 1990s, but also by the research carried out in the archives on this subject by the brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Saint-Cross who publicly denounced the abuses.
Collective redress must first pass the stage of admissibility in the upper court.
Once admissibility admitted by the Court, we proceed to the second stage, or the hearings on the substance.
In the case of the first resort, the consoration of Saint-Cross had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were carried out on the substance.
Imposing a fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in LSalle Arrtonation, in Montreal, in the night of Thursday on Friday.
The rescue was called to 1h, Friday, because of a fire that had declared itself in the subsoil of an Indian restaurant restaurant on the Dolard avenue, near the intersection with the Reje street.
The 30 firefighters who were sent on the scene took almost an hour to control the pot.
The fire has "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," indicated the head of the operations of the fire service in Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one in restaurant when the fire fighters arrived on the scene.
There have been no injuries, but almost 20 houses, located at the first and second shelves of this commercial premises, have had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was asked for, because residents of one of the apartments could have to be temporarily looted, indicated the SIM.
Many opposition to medical assistance to die in the palliative care Congress
The Canadian Government of palliative care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the draft law on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Association for Liliative Living, Maryse Boutette.
If we put the emphasis on palliative care in Canada, euthanasia's approach would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Meeting of Quebec also rejects the draft law on medical aid to die.
If it is adopted, Alberte Déry is worried about the consequences for the next generations.
"What's the meaning of life," he deplores.
The majority of palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of Palliative Living houses, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Franomène-Savomène house in Gatinwater, believes that the service would in any case be useless.
We never ask ourselves: "I want to die, give me an injection."
The director of the Ontario Association Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disentangles the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't believe that the Ontario will follow suit.
For its part, the Liberal MEP of Gatinwater, Stéphania Valley, says that the concept of end of life must be clarified before the bill is adopted.
The Kenyan press is indignant about the controversial media law
It's a frightening country and it's legitimate to ask ourselves the question: what will prevent Parliament from removing the independence of the judicial system tomorrow? It's said the newspaper by challenging the draft law and demanding that it be declared unconstitutional.
This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it, explained Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group, the owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected radio stations and websites in Kenya.
He indicated that the new media court will always be one-sided because it's an extension of the government and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the world economy.
I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this draft law and refer it back to the Members of Parliament, he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have a grip on the media. The Standard, for its part, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya had suffered a hard blow and rocked the bill as a draconian draconian.
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the commercial centre of Westgate last September.
The Kenyan media raised the anger of the authorities by disseminating images of video cameras on which the troops deployed on the stage of the attack supposedly defaulted the luxury business center.
The police chief, David Kimaiyo, reacted by convening two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the vocation was withdrawn following a shutdown of the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be able to be punishable by fines ranging up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being radiated or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of a offender if it did not pay its fine.
According to the Daily Nation, even a single fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations.
He also says that measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the animated blogosphere of Kenya.
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
No one will ever know, wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
Lived to them, politicians would put the country in default and we would return to hunt and cucking.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of popular anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission on salaries and restored their robotic salaries of about 532 000 shillings per month exempt from tax, which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Centre for Health and Social Services (CSSS) in Laval caused a great deal of commotion in the direction of the Hospital of City-Health, and this in 2012-2013.
Because of multiple retirement ages, maternity leave or departures, the pharmacy department has found itself severely deficient in staff.
It lacked nearly 30% of the staff needed, making this year 'very difficult', according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSS decided not to employ an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a fully-fledged pharmacist.
We did not use the scanning, explained Mrs Beaudet.
We rationalised or reduced some of our activities within the establishment of a patch, the time that things get up.
It's sure that we have worked hard to interest our young people [residents in pharmacies] so that they come and stay here.
There is a contest of circumstances that made it a bad situation last year.
Improved Situation
After this arduous period, 2013-2014 will be much easier for the CSSS pharmacy department.
Already, three pharmacists are returning to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
Furthermore, the efforts made by the department to retain have borne fruit, because the four pupils who are currently under house arrest in Laval also decided to stay on the CSS job.
Now it goes much better, highlighted the pharmacy.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three motherhood returns.
So this will close our departures from last year.
Less always growing
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospital or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations like that experienced in 2012 difficult to foresee.
For us [the number of staff] is still precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ many young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always go to three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
The last year, we have had much more and there are no pharmacists who are available to make substitutes, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old motorway doesn't start his career in the cinema by the small door.
The director, Lars von Trrier, chose to incarnate Charlotte Gainsburg in Nymphomanac, his next film.
This grandiose pornographic drama, eight chapters that will emerge in two parts (on 1 and 8 January 2014), the erotic memories of a quadruple to the sex since its adolescence.
The resemblance of Stay Martin with his elder is striking: a banner of brands, a diapapal tea and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who didn't hesitate to put down on glacial paper will be displayed in much more sullipsed situations on big screen.
An extract from Nymphomanac has raised the temperature on the Web: Stay Martin appears in the bed and in full excitement with Shia LaBeouf.
If the filmmaker asked his actors to put their puncers on the placard, he used X-X professionals for the most odious sex scenes, before merging all the numerically: above the belt, it's the star; below, the shower.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg, via Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trrier used to push his actress in their final tranches, always for the best.
Stoy Martin has not finished talking about it.
A CGR room from Nargood evacuated on Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted in the Mega CGR de Nargood, as a precautionary measure, following picks at the gorge felt by spectators.
Immediately, the director of the establishment proceeded to evacuate the room and warned the fire brigade for a suspect smell.
70 people have come out of the sitting.
People have been examined and full recognition of the room has not given anything.
Do you joke about a tearmogenic jet?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the cinema leadership has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its clients.
The room was delayed and everything went back to order.
The cinema has been able to resume its rights and customers find the pleasure of images.
Only on the screen.
She is trying to import 2 kg of cocaine in cides.
Passing on from the day of the Hallween, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine into the country hidden in cides, Thursday morning at the Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was when examining the baggage of the passenger that drugs could be detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three clichés that had previously been vivid.
Drugs were then transported to the office of the royal Gendarmerie of Canada (GRC) which took over in this investigation.
Canada's border services agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman came when she was intercepted.
It was part of the investigation, indicated Jacqueine Roby, the spokesperson for the ASFC.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border service officers at the Montreal-Trudeau airport have made 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, the officers of the border services in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of drugs.
Air planes against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range surface missiles SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of Tahal Airport in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has been confirmed neither by Israel nor by Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed in CNN an Israeli attack, aimed this time at missiles at sea Yakhhave, delivered by Russia in Damascus.
Israeli officials didn't hide their irritation to see Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine\ u0027s bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor" has lowered the solvency note of Ukraine on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to cope with its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's government debt goes to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, S & P, seeing at least one chance in three that it will be reduced again by a year.
"It's less and less likely that the government's strategy will allow sufficient foreign currency to be guaranteed to meet its high external financing needs", explain the American agency.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicted that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits made abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapse, the agency finds it increasingly likely devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of not having paid a bill of 882 million dollars.
This announcement constitutes bad news for Ukrainian power at a time of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious about Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public in the wake of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered between July and September its fifth quarter of contraction.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S & P estimates 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for months for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which granted it in 2010 a credit of $15.3 billion and has now released it only 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, notably by increasing gas prices to the population.
After a new unproductive mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the important external financing needs" constituted "vulnerability" while at the same time raising "signs of economic improvement."
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect a short-term improvement."
"There's little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year", with presidential elections scheduled for 2015, the expert, questioning the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S & P is also the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditioned on the release of the opposition Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences linked to Russia's reaction," explained S & P, which fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, warned that in the event of a free trade area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Green greed from the United States to the Publio-Omniccom merger
Publicly and Omniccom said Friday that there was no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus moving closer to the creation of the first global advertising agency.
The merger brings the second global agency, Omniccom, closer together, and the third, Public.
"Omniccom Group and Puliacitis Group announced today the expiry of the deadline for examining the previously announced merger of Puliatis Group and Omniccom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act of 1976, as amended", announce both groups in a communiqué.
They specify that they also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review deadline provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation of the operation.
'Fusion is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorisations and on the approval of the shareholders of both groups', add them.
The Congolese army pursues the rebels of the M23
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units will hunt the rebels of the M23 up to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
M23 appears to be on the point of being beaten after being driven out of the localities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that he controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago, of the insurgency.
"We'll continue with M23 and acit it wherever it hides because it is criminals", said in Reuters Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson for FARC.
We should not allow them to reorganise themselves because they martyred the people of Congo for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertror Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on FI that these military setbacks would not change his claims to peace talks in any way.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Chews are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to be dropped this week, as well as around Runyoni, a line where the rebellion of the M23 was born in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the province of North Kivu, taking advantage of the flight from the government garbage and the passivity of the blue helmets of Monusco.
Goma's fall brought the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the most important in the world in terms of staffing, to strengthen his mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade made up of South African, Malawi, and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC headquarters has been reworked and the army has gone to the offensive against M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," predicting an expert on Congolese affairs, Jahis Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - this would be the first time that the government in Kinshasa managed to beat a major insurgency.
And it would be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied in Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it outright, to support militarily the M23, consisting of former Congolese soldiers who were mutilated.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali talked about the possibility of military retaliation following shells falling into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgwall to welcome the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and we seemed unimaginable to be released by the army," testifies to an inhabitant of this locality bordering Uganda.
"We lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatised", added this man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected by the coronavirus turned out to be negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
It states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only confirmed cases in France so far."
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after being returned from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already claimed 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, reported on Friday of a fall in its quarterly benefit because of the fall in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in retreat from the group's objectives.
Its net benefit in the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, against 5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action, a year before.
The analysts surveyed by Reuters were on average on a profit advantage of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, rising relative to the 2.52 million pounds produced a year ago.
Society is targeting 2.65 million pps for this year, with 25% growth expected by 2017.
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment spending has increased by $7 billion in two years and should reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
The benefits derived from production activities fell slightly in the third quarter, while the profits of downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to 380 million dollars.
This drop in the refining margins affects the whole sector.
Thus, the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday of a net benefit falling, despite rising gas and oil production.
Transport of ecolink: the complaint deemed admissible
The school college of the Rhôrooke-Sherbrooke (CSRS) demands from the beginning of the school year the costs of $150 per pupil (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for school pupils in two homes, a service that the organization offers when it can do it.
Before the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested", explains Mrs Lefgin.
According to her, CSRS was invited to mediation and she asked for a further time to think about it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to concert and to find solutions," says Mrs Lefat.
The school Commission of the Rherbrooke-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organisation only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbraco around the closure of the Hôtel-God emergencies
Faced with the frontline conducted for several months by a number of staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Health Minister, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "disconnect the timetable for implementing the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to intervene on 4 November."
An official request "to avoid any risk of taking care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but was also aimed at not inhibiting the PS campaign to a few months of the municipalities.
Despite ministerial consignments, the closure should nonetheless be effective on that date.
Even if, in APP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
From November 4, the fire brigade that provided about a quarter of the 40 000 annual commuters to the emergencies of the Hôtel-God will all have received a signal to take the 30 serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the interlocals.
In the Hôtel-God, specialized personnel in emergencies will leave on Monday to five internal medical practitioners.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The Hôtel-God emergency service must close in the shortest time possible, and for us, it's 4 November," it unmistakably ensures Laoc Capreon, the chairman of the APP's medical commission (EMI), which supports the project's project.
"On 4 November, there will no longer be patients brought by fire fighters, only people from their own means," confirming Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical official of the new Hôtel-God.
"But we'll continue to welcome patients as a matter of urgency", temper it, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on the spot, assuring him as well.
But it's up to the ARS to decide the closure of the emergency service.
"Things are gradually being done", answers Nicolas Péju, the spokesman for the ARS for whom, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service."
"The minister lied us or he was lied", deplores the emergency physician Gérard Kierzek.
Demonstration of his position as head of the SMUR at the beginning of July for leading the frontloading project, he defined himself as an "early warning" against a "cynical" decision taken by "the mediocre-administrative technostructure."
"They are in the process of stealing and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he believes.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
They are regularly engulfed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting for the emergencies of Lariboiser.
In ARS, it is argued that 30 "dispatched" patients on several sites may not represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, the human resources of which will have been strengthened.
In ARS and APP, we defend the "new hospitality model" that has already been set in motion since 7 October and which should continue to receive 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist doctors should also be involved in setting up a "permanent care".
"Where are you going to ask people to self-diagnose", ask Gérally Kierzek for whom "the concept of a serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression"?
This will happen as for maternity-grade maternity motherhood.
People are not mad, they go to where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister doesn't take a measure by Monday, we're going to change the poet, preach Christopher Prudman, an emergency doctor and a member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP councillor from Paris and elected from the 4th arrow, clearly announces that "even if the UMP was in favour of maintaining emergencies in the Hôtel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if you bear responsibility."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, has again reminded us on Monday morning of France Inter that she had declared herself in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, it would mark its net disagreement, underscore Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-God has its legitimacy on the substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama put an end to the headphones directed at the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to the tapes that it used on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities, indicate an American official, Thursday.
This decision is part of the attempt by the White House to take up the hand in the case of the NSA's heirs after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the supervision of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Interreg on the subject, a head of the US administration replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Speaking under the cloak of anonymity, this responsibility did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official has indicated that Barack Obama has given an order to stop these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given roughly at the same time as the end of the heels of the UN headquarters in New York.
Against this background, the Senate Senate approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programmes but allowed them to continue.
The committee has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information.
The UN welcomes the new objectives for combating poverty
The United Nations will now start working on a new set of objectives intended to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to fight poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the objectives of sustainable development that are intended to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the day before Rio de Janeiro.
They were in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it's now time to move beyond national interests.
I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process of setting universal sustainable development objectives (ODD), he added.
These DDCs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of sustainable development objectives based on the success of the MDGs.
The concern about security in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts break out between powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Sama Machhel, the founder president of Mozambique, who is killing them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to changer peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
We want peace to return; we want stability, said Vanessa de Sousa, a general director of an investment company.
Inquet for the future of his country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tee-shirt with the mention. We want security in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd on the place of the Independence of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports almost every day of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clouds since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, supported initially by Rhodesia governed by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa in the effort to destabilise the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think that the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy since the discovery of huge reserves of offshore gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 million of investment over the next few years from companies like Rio Taro, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko of the United States.
The Flémo, the governing party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo mutually rejects the responsibility for tensions.
The Renamo declares that the government is responsible for recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of the Reno, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazzana, the Reno spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes the Reno responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Mr Guebuza declared Wednesday to the AFP, the French press agency, that Mr Dhakama regarded himself as a loser. He wanted to use all the forces he left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.
The Flémo and the Reno insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew up after Mr Mazzana declared that the Reno was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He said to the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Flémo.
We want to resume the negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness, Mr Mazzana has indicated.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to allay tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
They are two big men (Guebuza and Dhakama) who don't stop arguing, explained Joseph Hlon, a conscientier of the open university and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them can well negotiate and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to take place in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted his use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a treasure of war from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamant has steadily declined since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former Reno member, should obtain more votes in the elections.
Mr Mazzana said that Mr Guebuza, who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency, said Mr Mazzana.
We don't know exactly what the Renamo's capacity is, but it has led to disruptive attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most clings took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where is Bira, the port of where mining companies, especially Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railways for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr Mazzana was falsely timid when he was asked if the Reno would respond to this threat.
The Reno wanted to warn the international community that things do not go well in Mozambique, as Mr Mazzana said.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, declares Fernando Lima, director of Mediacop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
People think that those responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and that it's up to them to find solutions to the problems, he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a manifestation, said that people only wanted stability.
No one cares about Reno or Flo, they just want to return to peace, they want free access to the roads, he added.
We should teach the myths and legends to children as a model of lifestyle models, says the author.
The Légende de Thor could show that the brutal force does not carry weight in the face of subtle ruin, while the legends of arthurians reveal the importance of having a dream.
Don that many myths would be far too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases too obscure to be taught at school, Crosley-Holland advocated a careful selection of works adapted to age.
I find it extraordinary that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education, he said.
I have been arguing for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are openly diddactic is that children get completely out of the picture, messages being sublied in pleasant stories.
Crosley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norths and British Fok Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And he must be supervised; revealed through a history rather than declared.
The well-known basis of what we show and what we don't say.
A fighter of the armed wing of Hamas has been killed this evening and another injured by an Israeli hair attack in the Gaza Strip. Have we learned from medical and security sources in Gaza?
According to these sources, these activists led a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they had a shells fired at an Israeli banner.
Espying of NSA: the US has gone too far, admitting Kerry
The US sometimes went "too far" in spying, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first confession of Washington in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and decay between the United States and their European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the interception by the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I concede to you, as the President did, some of these actions went too far and we will make sure that this happens no longer in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London that he participated in since Washington on Thursday 31 October by a video link.
In his speech broadcast, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified intelligence and information-gathering practices by the necessary fight against terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had had many projects of attacks since the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We've prevented planes from falling, building blocks exploded and people are murdered, because we were able to be informed upstream of these projects," argued the patron of American diplomacy.
And he said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people, they have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far," he still admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
Thursday evening he assured us that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels wrong".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, which quotes documents obtained from the ex-consultant of the NSA Edward Snowden, says that the programme known as "MéUSCULAR", and led with the British NSA counterpart, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibre used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million elements had been collected in the last month alone - ranging from metal on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection with these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain, or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have intercepted massive data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listen, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, has denied him that his intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of European citizens "communications.
He even sent the ball back to the European intelligence services who would have seized these communications before supplying them to the NSA.
This would concern "military operations" in countries where NATO allies cooperate with the United States, and this would not really be about Europe, said General Alexander.
And the controversy extended on Friday to Asia.
Indonesia convened the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans in a vast web of international espionage that also provoked China's shy.
Paris Saint-Germane will receive Lorizon Friday without its master asset, the Swede Zlaan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League of League 1 in a communiqué.
The PSG, the leader of the championship in Monaco versus aims, has broadcast the list of players held for this 12th day match, without the attack on 32 years.
The communiqué simply says that he is "injured" without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he was suffering from an inflammation of the left of the left during his return to selection, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the Deliberated Death
The crematorium of the Pather Lachine organises, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased people created in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate in Paris City, must attend, and then explain, at a press conference his proposals for funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsessions, more and more French people choose the creation, rather than the inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsessions of a close, it's the opposite: the French prefer the inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune to lose a child, they are only 15% to choose the creation.
In his book The Death in ash, Damien Le Guay, the philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Ethics of the Tfuneral, insists on the "violence" that is the creation, for the survivors.
There is, with the creation, "violence against the loved body," which will be "reduced to a lot of ash" in a very short time, and not after a process of decay, which "would accompany the phases of the mourning."
There is also 'symbolic violence', which is based on the "erroneous nature and the distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ash.
Why is it that what is readily accepted in some Nordic countries and Protestants is still badly lived in France?
"Because the creation is a new fact," replies Marie-Frédérique Bacé, President of the Society of Theatology and author of the book Claiming the death.
It is tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to apprise it.
Claiming the creation, it's for François Michot-Néard, Director General of the funeral Services of the Paris City, to provide for the deceit a ceremony as worthy as the one he would be entitled to with an inhumation.
The annual investigation of Ipsos shows a very strong commitment to the organisation of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, that it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now 73% of people who have chosen a creation want to organise a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
The crematoria have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For about ten years, they've been trying to avoid families the violence of a wait, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ash of ash," observes Mr Michot-Néard.
Seventy per cent of establishments now offer masters of ceremonies, who procure, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: welcoming the assembly, naming the deceit, linking it to others, raising it, giving meaning to its death, organising the adolescence.
This is the case in the Cématorium of the Pather Lachine, since 1998.
The masters of ceremony are often people who have retrained.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It's within this framework that the crematorium of the Pather Lachine organises, since 2010, the day of La Toussaaint, several ceremonial memory, secular and non-religious ceremonial, to which he invites the families of the people who were created in the year.
For the second year running, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not travel.
The crematorium allowed us to pass it on.
In Seychn, Relocation for the sake of rats turned into controversy
Earlier this week, a family left its apartment on the floor of the D2 building, because of the presence of rays.
Faced with the urgency of the situation, the director of the South Habitat office, has proposed, exceptionally and temporarily, to relocate the couple and his three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, estimates Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rates, there have always been in the cities.
The company of denationalisation makes two passages per year, and in addition, we intervene, to our burden, at every request from the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been made.
The neighborhood is not left behind, and the rats don't pull in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, denomination products are four times less effective than in the past, admittedly, but for two rats, we will not kill a god.
"We've not invited the rats at home", defending the father of the family who left his house to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the soothing and we expect a new housing, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ends up falling by 0.88%, ATM
Tokyo's stock market ended on Friday, despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The coate has suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, which is detrimental to exporting values and the warning about its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix gave 1123 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony has fallen from more than 11% to 1 668 yen.
A house plagued by flame retardants in the Vicebec
A fire that started on Friday lunchtime in the Vicebec was quickly mastered.
More than a dozen firefighters were sent to 9 of the street Hebrert.
The flames have declared themselves in a house of three houses divided on four shelves situated behind the court of Quebec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was mastered one hour after the arrival of the fire fighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"So the alarms have succeeded, because it was stepping up to attack the building, because it's built buildings here," explained France Lorst, the spokesperson for Quebec firemen.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman: The Di10th anniversary of New York Compact: The New Yorker
You could say that the city of New York is the place where the Stop-upp in America originated: almost 100 years ago, the player of the vulgar Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony in the Palace Theater, on Broadway, began to tell blacks directly to the public, on the tone of conversation.
Fay innovation has been perpetuated over the years, until more recently by New York Compensation Festival.
Created and overseen by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Clup-upp Carolines club, the festival celebrates his tenth birthday this year, with more than 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and big theatres.
Most of the posters have emerged in Carolines, and they have had a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club, said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
The event this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maer and the presentation of Stand Up for Heroes, a night of comedie and music to the former combatants, organised in Madison Square Garden, to which, among others, Bruce Stringsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival has grown on the scale, like the world of the comedy.
Several of the comedians participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, by, for example, showing spectacles on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has appeared on the front of the scene in a coocom on a cable channel (The Hague Times on the theme of fantasy soccer football in the FX chain) and now has its own spectacle of sketchs on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate took part in the broadcasts of Saturday Night Live and was part of the casting of the series of Parks and Recreation. But she is more famous for her series of viral videos, Marcel the Shell.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians in the singular voice (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironical advocate of racial justice, W. Kamin Bell), are purs produced from the decentralized world of the American comedian.
One of the main factors for attracting the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a comedy of Stop-upp, but he became a film and television film director accomplished, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedie.
Between 2005 and 2007, he animated a broadcast on TV Land, which called it "Sit Down Comedy." David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at the Hôtel de Ville, in the centre of Manhattan.
The city is definitively in the comic DNA of all the work of Larry, declared Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he was descending a ruil between two buildings and saying, if I lose all my money, maybe I'm going to live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and move closer to $96 the barrel
The price of oil continued to drop on Friday, while concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing sector is growing in strength.
The price of US Gross Reference Gross Domestic Product in December fell from 14 cents to 96.24 dollars per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during the electronic exchanges on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a drop of 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed up prices over the last few weeks.
The US Department of Energy indicated Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on China's manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to shrink after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Gross Brent, a reference for international GDP already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 the barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Reference to the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal restored to Texas certain restrictions on the right of voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a judge of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in this state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice IVG will have to have an "admission privilege" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, according to his status as a doctor caring for a hospital, to admit a patient in a hospital or a medical centre to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Opponents of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of a third of state clinics because these clinics failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be almost 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments.
On Monday, a judge of first instance estimated on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were anti-constitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, the Republican Greg Abbott, who bribes the post of governor, asked the Court of Appeal to annul the judgment of first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary session on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a return to strength, with hearings, with 1.3 million viewers behind their post office, 5.6% of audience.
But was the spectacle at the meeting?
Some 10 000 candidates have presented themselves to the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the Sinclear Part, the perche André Manoukian and Olivier Netherlands.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
The excitement to return to their favourite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really marked this first premium.
As every year, the first round broadcasts breed a wide choice of songs in grass, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Well, on Twitter, you want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocation of a successful singer is still there, season after season.
Others have just the ambition to laugh.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and searches
A federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the control and control program of the New York police department and despatching the file.
The US Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Schinddlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city has called for its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department change its policy and the training programme associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal said that the judge should be drawn to the file because she breached the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly because of a series of interviews given to the media and public statements in which she publicly responded to critics of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black men and of Hispanic as part of their control and searches.
She appointed an external supervisor to oversee changes, including reform of policies, training and supervision, and she ordered the setting up of a pilot programme to test cameras on the body in areas where the greatest number of controls take place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after police control.
The hearing of the appeal by the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of control and searches has been criticised by many defenders of civil rights.
This control and control system has existed for decades in a certain form, but the number of checks recorded has risen dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic.
Judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Those who advocate changes in the NYPD control and control programme say that they will put an end to unfair practices, allow more effective police forces and trust, and can change the way the police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after police officers have been severely reduced over the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not put an end to the practices of control and searches, which are constitutional, but that she reformed the way in which the NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must vote, because each of them pays on average $100 per month on the price of housing that goes to the Ville.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each housing.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the Ville.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay fireworks to $100 000, land from 4 to 5 million for the case where...
Go to vote, it's the best way to speak and say that it's enough.
End of service for the Elysée head
Entered in the 500 m2 of the eleciseel kisdoms, as committed after working in embassies, the cook has engulfed all levels until becoming leader, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande via Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and fed countless large numbers of the world in almost anonymity that he only now breaks, at retirement age, at 60.
The man with an open face, the unbearable clouds and glasses of intellectual, born on 24 October 1953 to the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is holding a CAP of pasta.
His mother was herself cooking in a castle of Soologna.
"I've moved from a castle to the other!", ironise Bernard Véraeffect, who knows not only the six presidents for whom he has been an officer, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guys.
"It's always the head of state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus", he recalls.
"Mrs Chirac was a bit more involved, she came directly into the kitchen", to the point that she banned women in the Elysée cuisine!
Out of the heads of state who displayed relative indifference to land fed, "they're all gurgeons," he gently denounces Bernard Vaurition.
Jacques Chirac had "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed cheese, the beans were empty!
As for François Hollande, who reinstated cheese, "It's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much that he doesn't like."
The current Head of State, who regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has no request for a specific regime. "
Bernard Vaurition also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at the state dinners at Elysée: "Between 200 and 250 people in one hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand if there were mistakes.
The old head of the Elysée kitchen, who took a glass on Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, starts with a pink at the heart. "François Hollande welcomed me."
He said praise.
"His human side has emerged," he says.
The head will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years, who for his part has been in the Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
An historic house built in 1850 was the prey of the flames in the Vues-Quebec Friday lunchtime.
The building of four houses, located on the 15 of the street Hebrert, was subject to three alarms with the fire service.
The fire was declared before, but rose on the three stars of the building.
France Voisher, spokesperson for the Fire Protection Service in Quebec, has specified that rapid fire intervention has prevented the spread of flame retardants to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built in an approximate way.
The house burnt was four houses, but no tenants were on the scene at the time of the fire.
The damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin, but the sabers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.

Coule used the telephone hacking to check a tuyau
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used the telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation to try to confirm a bidon tug on a link involving the Minister of the Interior at the time, Charles Clarke.
Practiur Andrew Edit QC told the World Bailey Tribunal that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Powlby, his beautiful special adviser.
It was pointed out to the court that the newspaper has commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hacker the voice box of Pwlby and to keep him constantly in front of his door, but Coulson also called him and gave him voice messages.
The accusation suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay before people's house in hoping to overtake them, it's the kind of man to love to present history to people to see what they say about it, said Mr Edit.
He said that NotW used three means to investigate subjects: telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, supervision, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Is he aware of the telephone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say, of course, that if you do.
The rumours about a link involving Clarke were taken first by the office of NotW when a source, having sexually attractive to Miss Powlby, said that he was told: "Do not lose your time with her, she is with Charles.
A band, on which registered voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at the house of Mulcaire in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the computer of the private detective that related to Miss Powlby and his sister in a file of Project.
During the period when the detective investigated her, the grandparents of Miss Powlby received anonymous calls for information on her, added Mr Edit.
Meanwhile, the former reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former postponement James Weatherop oversaw the monitoring of the least facts and gestures of Miss Powlby.
In a vocal message he gave him on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow, of which I really would like to speak at Charles.
Mr Edit explained that the involvement of Coulson in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had to face Mr Blunkett about a link with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hacker telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherupp admitted that they had made telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives the Prime Minister of Iraq, in the midst of a surge of violence
The US president should receive Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday 1 November 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1 600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher toll with 979 dead and 1 902 injured.
This violence is increasingly murderous despite reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiites.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1 073 people had been killed.
Two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence fears a new conflagration while neighboring Syria is in a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men are shot on the street or even at home, and the security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who claims to be politically marginalized and to be the target of unjust arrests, has encouraged this surge of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (EIIL), a group affiliated to Al Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in Syria's civil war.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "global war" against Al Qaeda.
The violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on 12 December 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country, painted an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival on Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the elected representatives of Congress.
Thursday, he argued for the international community to conduct a "Third World War" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased support for Iraq in security matters is supported by influential Republican and Democrat senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy."
They also demanded Barack Obama to make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran in the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses an Uighur group of the Tiananmen attack
The head of Chinese internal security accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang to be behind the car bomb bomb that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in the Beijing centre on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, went to the crowd that was on the famous place of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and took fire killing its three passengers and two passers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the political bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan to be the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkophone minority installed in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that take place there with separatist claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that took place in Beijing was organised and premeditated", said Meng to the Gong-konger Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was sitting behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, his words are taken up by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he was of Uyghur origin and said that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers full of petrol and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injured.
The Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major survey throughout the world on how the parks handle sensitive dossiers such as contraception, divorce and couples trained by the same sex.
The poll asks participants how priests care about gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage links.
The poll was sent in mid-October at each national conference of bishops, with the sign of obtaining as many answers as possible.
Information will serve an important rally on the family that Pope François plans to organise next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporting", an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesperson for the Conference of Catholic bishops in the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that every bishop would decide how to think about the parissians.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the poll on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The army attacks the last rebel fiefdom
The irrecoverable of M23, or a few hundred combatants, were cut back to nearly 2000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chancellor, Runyyi and Mbubzi, close to Bunagana and Joma, two localities located around 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It's not stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," indicated to the AFP an inhabitant of Joma, joined by phone to 12.30 p.m., and according to whom a girl was injured by bullshit in the morning.
"The intensity of clashes has diminished a little," he added, "it seems that the FARC armed forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, soldiers had "spent night" in Joma before moving to the front for a "rationing operation."
We heard very clearly from him about the crepers fed with light weapons.
De Bunagana, the political fiefdom and the last strong place of the rebellion fell on Wednesday, a journalist from the AFP could hear tonnages of heavy weaponry.
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the stabilisation of the DRC, the fighting entered "in a final phase," the FARDC "encircle the positions of the 23 residual people for the demarcation".
Since the resumption, Friday, clashes between the Movement of 23 Marks (M23) and the army, Monusco does not participate directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of this afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well-supplied munitions, went to the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier on, on the road leading to Bunagana, the border post with Uganda, soldiers aided by civilians were carrying out a multiple rocket launcher on a new FARDC truck, to ensure the rest of another guy poisoning the positions of M23 on the hills.
The Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, called on the rebels on Wednesday night to "voluntarily demobilize" under sentence of being disarmed "by force" but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results for the time being.
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We finished the talks, we only have Ugandan mediation to organise the signature", said Roger Lumbaa, vice-president of the delegation of 23, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, former rebels, mostly tumsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-soil is full of veiled mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5000 people were refugees between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the movement of return to the DRC that started in the morning was reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to replicate," said to the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by its nine children, including a infant on the back.
We get the impression that fire breaks are coming closer to the people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of inhabitants crossed the border, some with a guy on the head, to pass the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this beast of the scene
Classique, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the song and danced productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the musical to French is affirmed as a kind of success.
Long, from our Lady from Paris to Mozart the opera opera, most attempts would be made in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or the Missile were the guy of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Chastelet and the St. Etertainment in Mogador has changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes run headlines like tubes for success.
The first restarts, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the global creation of "an American in Paris."
In Mogador, "La Best and Best" could well be one of the success stories of the season.
On the other scenes, musical spectacles like "1789", "the amateurs of the Bastille" and the small musical comeditions like "Disco" or "Life and Times" are coming to terms with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Historic comedy of musical comeditions" and confer on Chastelet's theatre, analyzes the reasons for the success that has been so hard won.
How do the French musical comeditions evolve?
The supply has multiplied.
First, there are the "musical spectacles" that evolve according to producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a real story like in 1789, the Basttille's Asians.
Others make a 15-year-old leap backwards on the pretext that you can serve almost everything when you have Matt Polkora in front of the poster.
After that, we have musical comeditions with the sompous productions of Chastelet that make us return to the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sonhheim, the largest composer composer living.
Enterinthine is popularizing the Anglo-Saxon musical comeditions of variety by adapting them in French.
French independent producers are trying a breakthrough.
But projects under way like "Re", "Le Baier of the woman arted," or "the Spring of the spring", have difficulty being financed.
Do we have enough artists capable like Broadwali of songs, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical spectacles in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn project projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical comedy, it's very different.
Young people are trained in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, peat, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The vivid of talent is as important as the number of posts to be filled.
Why are the pros in the province so successful?
Apart from the opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few theatre parts go to tour and it's often the theatre theatre for adults and not young adults.
Musical spectacles fill this gap.
It's the same young people who love television and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical spectacle, it's the insurance of an inflow of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are appalled by professionals who answer questions.
These spectacles are very expected when they arrive in a Zumith province.
The Maynaise has risen in Paris and disguised by provincial provincial forces.
Shop is designed to enter all the big French rooms in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning to 5.30 p.m., on the internal ring of Brussels to the height of Hoilarart, to Waterloo.
The car of a driving force has been lost by a ghost driver who is unscathed.
The ring was closed to circulation, up to 900, in the place of the accident, the time that the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause any traffic jams because the accident took place at the height of the Hoilarart exit.
Movement was therefore able to be diverted by this exit / entry from the ring.
A child seriously injured in a attraction to Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured following an accident on a attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer committed but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a ship of attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean."
It has been closed up to a new order.
DRC: The army is preparing a new assault
Children play on a carbon carnage that belonged to the rebels of the M23, in Kitba, on 31 October 2013, in the east of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for Friday to another assault against the last bastions of the rebels of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the east of the DRC.
The aim is to remove the M23 of the hills that overshadow Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill in Bugina, which overshadows that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbubzi should fall by itself.
There will only be the Runyyi hill.
"The company of Chancellor is not very strategic," said the AFP governors the governor of North Kivu, Julilinu Pluku.
Mr Pluku plans to go on Saturday a Bunagana.
Politicians and last strong place of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, several hundred unrelenting of the M23 have been cut back to almost 2, 000 metres of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chancellor, Runyonyi and Mbubzi, close to Bunagana and the neighbouring town of Joma.
In Joma, an inhabitant who had reported all close fights on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation was "quiet since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fights of the day and were buried.
A girl was injured by the ball, and three other people were injured, including an uprising, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two warring parties have not given any account of losses in human lives.
The revelations of the NSA increase the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance
By a fine day at the end of August, a German police helicopter overran at low altitude the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BVV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photographate the roof of the American outpost, located below 5 km of the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explain that the BVV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennatics and that the operation provoked an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clayer, the US intelligence director, again insisted in September that the US doesn't use their foreign intelligence capabilities to steal foreign companies "industrial secrets for the benefit of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became whistleblowers, began to reveal his inexhaustible wealth of information about the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and corporate leaders don't know if the director of the word should be believed.
Reports, according to which the US National Security Agency has spurred Brazil's oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by US suppliers of storage services in Cloud, notably Google and Yahoo, have more than ever generated the paranoia of companies with regard to state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that broke the caveat.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate managers are surely also potential targets.
Snowden made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
Germany must wake up, declare Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies think that the United States represents such an important risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the EY cabinet.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has sent industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient computer and Internet capabilities and believes that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A Member of the German Parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
This is not the right way to go, indicates Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't need to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidised in Germany, coal to cars, and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
But the extent and sophistication of US espionage agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations were a shock for some companies that thought until China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is taking place in cloud computing, since European officials have realised that data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional body, some 10% of non-US members have given up their plans to use an American supplier of storage services in the cloud after the revelations on the American programme for exploring Prism data.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients ask us today a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It's not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There have always been.
It has been a recurring theme for many years and nothing has changed fundamentally in the current discussion, declaiming Kurt Bock, Director-General of the company producing BASF chemicals.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just like we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are usually reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, if this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been saying the message that it's at least reckless to recover a free USB key in a professional room or to leave a laptop computer without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the automobile manufacturer Audi, says that the collection of mobile phones before Council meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones paid during their travels abroad because of the risk of infringing the integrity of the smartphones.
The pre-paid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorised access, and warn the BVV in a report.
The United States alerts their own companies to business espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty of the second degree of carrying out acts of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, the French are the worst ones.
Bernard S4cini, former French intelligence director, DCI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy their allies.
The parents of a teenager of Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, think that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager of Georgia, whose body was found in a shambles of a rough ride in the gymnasia of his school, think that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, Valdsta in Georgia, was found on 11 January stuck in a carpet supported behind the gymnasia of his school.
The sheriff investigators of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson was dead in unusual circumstances, but the family of 17-year-old boy contests these conclusions.
They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered, declared Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacheyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff conclusions.
They think that it defies logic, the laws of physics and the common sense, added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered with the sole aim of covering the people responsible for the death of their son.
They sent their son to school with a cartable and they were made in a mortuary bag, he added.
The US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was carrying out an official investigation on Johnson's death, pointing out that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow up the facts, wherever they lead.
My aim is to discover the truth.
I think there is a sufficient basis to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told journalists that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was deceased by a positional asphyxiation.
But a second auopsy has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
There are a number of questions that still deserve a response or confirmation, he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements that justify a civil or criminal investigation on Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff office of Lowndes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge from Georgia in the south ordered the authorities on Wednesday to submit all video recordings that the investigators had examined.
The parents of teenager have said that they hope that video images contain indications on the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishes advice on allergies in the child to schools
On Wednesday, the American Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published a series of directives indicating how to deal with the food allergies of children at school.
This is the first series of guidelines that the US Government publishes, since the number of children in school age with food allergies has soared sharply.
A child in 20 in the United States today suffers from food allergies.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information intended for schools on how to raise awareness of the desecessoral body and staff with food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends to schools to have a stock of epephemine, the self-inpinator of the EpicPen brand is the most commonly used in order to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially lethal analanxia.
The legislative assemblies of the states have recently updated regulations to allow schools to have more easily from the epiphine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms communicated by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, I get the impression that something like me is the language of the language, I get the impression that I have a hair on the language, or that I have plots on the language.
The NSA case highlights the complete absence of a debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which of a cooked in public by convening the United States ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the overflying of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on his board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande phone to Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius contests the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of US surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of Le Monde to a few weeks of interval on the one hand the reproduction of US diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the tapes of the Quai de Orsay by the NSA?
Would it not be like a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on analysis by American diplomacy of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in view of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it's not in any way to distract us from this practice, it's to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The fact that the United States, but also France, has been in place for nearly ten years, has officially been justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this field, France and the United States, in particular, have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of almost daily information and are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to pass whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and in return - as has already been said quickly - the Americans can give information to the French on other parts of the world.
So the basic question behind this NSA affair is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially in the parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and ultimately the question of attacks on freedoms.
What are the United States really risking?
You may denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk run by the Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top summit of their governments, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the US have strained.
Another effect can be more economic: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American providers subject to US laws, and thus to the capture of NSA.
My final point: the vast movement of revelations committed by media around the world, which helps to trigger a debate on intelligence intelligence practices so far almost non-existent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they gave to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersexualized children can choose an unspecified sex.
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the new born will no longer be awarded them, in a rigid way, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be obliged to declare the sex of their child, authorizing them to include an unspecified sex or non-specified person on his certificate of birth.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure that weighed on parents who could take hasty decisions concerning a surgery of sexual reassignment for their infants, and to fight against discrimination against sexualized people.
According to the BBC, an intersexualized person would have said years later, I'm not a man or a woman.
I will remain the patchwork that doctors, condoms, and bullets have created.
It is estimated that a child on 2 000 born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexualized, intersexuality forming part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorder of sexual development, a generic term naming people with chromosomes or gamblers (eggs or staples) atypical or sexual organs that are abnormally developed.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexualized.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to attribute it, then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Drack Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and specialist questions of sexual identification, said that the new German law seems to be a good idea.
Inter-sex children pose an ethical dilemma.
Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act, but this is not the case with most children, he added.
There can be a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child develops sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described people intersexually as different from transsexuals or transgender, since their status is not linked to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively that of a man or exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in the secondary sexual characters, such as the muscular mass, pilotage, the showcase and the trainee, the primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also gave an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexually and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-compliant kind now have camps that are particularly destined for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female, or third sex in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognised as neutral after winning his appeal trial, which allows him to keep a sex that is not specified for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F X for intersexuities, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition so that gender theory is removed from school books.
The American site Catholics Online also opposed German law, writing that, since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, you turn two other pillars of civilisation.
In Maryland, the mother of a infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child, she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainties.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called hermaphit, according to the name of the beautiful Greek God who had a dual sex.
And, just about ten years ago, the medical community regarded gender as an ardue, which can be wiped out and on which we can redesign.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reasnaissance when he grows.
In the middle of the 20th century, we called this a psychiatric emergency, and said Drescher.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we telephoned the surgeon.
The dominant theory about how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr John Money, from the Johns-Hopkins University, who considered that gender is evil.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" to the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals to the way in which parents raise a child interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it is identified as male or female sex.
But in a case of 1966, known as John / Joan, his theories gave rise to controversy.
He advised the parents of a little boy whose pens had been cut off in a botched circumcision to do it completely, by kidnapping him as well, and raising it as a girl.
Money presented this as a case of successful transition, but it was not the case, declared Drescher.
At the age of 15, he became a boy and married with a woman.
But 38 years ago, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors always repeat this model.
But in the 1990 "s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex-change operations say" [...] they are not satisfied with the result.
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer of Montana, who was born with chromosomes XY but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large cliché or a small penny and were convinced that he could never have a decent life as a man.
So little time after its birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical abdication of the external body and the testiculers and was high as a girl.
Women were given hormone hormones at the age of 12.
I knew I was not a girl, he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years he has suffered a vaginoplasis.
But depressed and realized that something was wrong, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered was horrified.
I was sterilised at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough tesstersterone for its sexual organs to develop.
Having learned the truth, he has become a man, following treatment at testosterone and kidnapped the seins.
The surgery made it sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organisation called Interface Project, trying to normalise the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mats, Director General of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law invites labelling and stigmatisation.
Many activists worry that German law encourages parents to take quick decisions and give their children an "undetermined" sex, she said.
We are afraid that it encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to give a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only put forward hypotheses.
Tamar-Mats said that his organisation supported Australian law because it allows adults to choose to be recognised under the third sex.
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind of thing, or she added.
The German law concerns the award of sex at birth.
It's not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specialized in the mammographs in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law will make parents and children responsible.
Dr Baratz's daughter, Katriz, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called full insensitivity to anodogens.
As a result of the failure of its anodogenic receivers, Kacy has developed women's characteristics.
She has a vagery, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29 years old, Kaurry is married and internal psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or wearing mothers.
The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so that they don't have to take hasty decisions, as Baratz said.
This gives them time to carry out certain tests and to understand them, and a deadline before they include male or female feminine.
So it's all well and good that you can raise your child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being parent.
You don't have to rush for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
It puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they fear not to do what is needed, he said.
Finally, the child will decide what sex he / she feels the / most comfortable, and it's something wonderful.
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.
Letta entrusted with the longevity of its government
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta judges that his government will keep up until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition in the run-up to the Senate vote to defeat Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In a daily interview Le Stampa, the center-left leader says "firm intent" to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, makes his dismissal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the Freedom Party (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last year his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's injunctions that already wanted to crack down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the US Transport Agency, TSA, and a suspect have been injured during the exchange of fire.
The fire brigades called on the scene of the tragedy claimed that they responded to a call for "multiple wounded."
"The forces of order are on the spot", precise the airport on his Twitter account, while television pictures show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," said to the AFP a spokesperson for the US transport safety agency (TSA).
The local antenna of ABC showed a person evacuated on a headache, and a second transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at 9.30 a.m. (12.30 in Montreal) at terminal 3 at the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times specifies that the towers 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The spokesman for the TSA was not able to confirm immediately if one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israel's army kills a Hamas member in Gaza.
Israeli tanks killed on Thursday an Islamist Palestinian militant Hamas and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, it was learned after sources of health services.
A source of Hamas has explained that fighting broke out in this region, because Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by firing Palestinian morals.
The Israeli army has merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area close to a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Jewish state, widened at the border and whose discovery was announced in October.
Report: The Obama campaign considered to be leaving Biden for Hillary Clinton
Advisors closest to President Barack Obama have considered, in the greatest secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event that appears in the very long book of the 2012 campaign of Mark Halperin and John Hein, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and said on Thursday night that the president's closest collaborators had carried out thorough work in groups and polls at the end of 2011 to see if Biden could help Obama for his re-election while his hopes were diminishing.
According to the political correspondent of Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior officials in the campaign and the White House, namely former Secretary General of the White House Bill Déry, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice-president by former Secretary of State Clinton might have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that was fiercely guarded in the QG campaign of Chicago and within the oval office.
Only half a dozen councillors of the president, including Daléry, former Obama campaign chief Jim Mesina and former advisors in the White House David Axelrod and David Pouffe, knew that the change was underway.
Dounble Down says that Déry has led the charge to replace Biden, despite their close personal ties, before finally deciding against change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success.
In an interview with Martin, Déry confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden by Clinton.
I said that I had looked at a whole series of questions, and it was one of them, said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in the form, so we were told, the Lord, what can we do?
While Daley described the examination of concert as a concert, Martin indicated to Anderson Coper CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to discover whether change would be beneficial during the vote.
Campaigns do not spend a lot of money on surveys and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action, declared Martin on AC360.
But we don't know if Obama knew that his team looked at replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he asked Daly if his boss then knew about the possible reshuffle.
Though Déaly said that he didn't think that the president was aware of the possible change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was possible for Obama to know.
Martin added that Dounble Down did not answer definitively the question of whether political polls had arrived on Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn't know that the removal of Biden from the presidential list was considered.
Perhaps you're going to answer Martin.
Do you want a fluid ice?
A British entrepreneur has created the first fluorocratic ice in the world based on meadow.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluororescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminant collision.
He had the idea after reading a study on the misses and convinced Chinese scientists to recreate the brilliant protein chemically.
The ice cream reacts with the language by increasing the pH of the protein to make it brilliant.
Chris explains that, since the ice cream begins to read when she responds to the heat of the mouth, the more we like, the more brilliant it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the glacial society, Lick Me, I'm Delicious, said: "It's something incredible but we are still only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 g of this trick costs about £200."
The protein that we use in the ice reacts with a neutral H-H language.
So when your mouth warmes the protein, the level of poH increases and the ice is shining.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with all of you at the time of the Hallween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I have created because the lumination of meats is worth four times more expensive than gold.
Every single shop costs me about £140.
But it's good taste!
Society at the experimental démarche of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice perfume such as beer, cheese, beef and the gold sheet.
But his next creation will be even more ambitious.
He added: I really want to develop an invisible ice.
This is inherently impossible because of the refragmentation caused by the ice crystals that constitute the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluororescent properties of the misconception synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a taskforce session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was carrying out exercises exercises. He revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the Regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died Sunday morning, when he looked the trees and made the famous 21st movement of tai chi, with his hands of musicians who filed the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master tai, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she promised her husband, the week before her death, to get her out of the hospital and to take it to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it's our spiritual house.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the wonderful joy of living he had", add it.
Lou Reed had last May undergone a liver transplant.
Hallen 2013: in figures
When I was a little, Hallween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bonuses, go to sleep late and disguise ourselves to go to the neighbourhood.
Today, I have become more ingrained.
In the last two years I have not distributed a single good and I will certainly not do it this year.
But the stats show that I'm the black sheep when we talk about Hallween.
The majority of Americans, in fact, are going to celebrate Hallween this year, spending a total of $6.9 million in sweets, cooking and decorations, according to the National Return Federation.
What I look forward to at every party in Hallween, it's the trends.
Fossies should represent $1.2 million over the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see many zombie, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the space of Daft Punk will be among our Istagscratm photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after disguises are zombies, Batman, hackers and witches.
I suppose there is no difficulty in remaining traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my amazement, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 M in disguise for animals this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of strange dogs disguised in dogmatism.
When it comes to bonuses, we don't shy away.
Americans will spend $1.9 million on bonuses this year, according to the Nielsen cabinet.
This amounts to about 272 million kg of Barre Hearhey, sugars, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and bar Clark.
It's a super news for the 41 million children who go to the hunting of bonuses in their neighborhood, according to the American Department of Commerce.
In fact, we are going to buy and, let us not tell you stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Hallween.
Good maize is the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Hallween, according to the National Conflict Association.
This represents around 9 billion grain grain.
It's a mystery that I have not yet managed to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Hallween than Hanged houses.
They wear the best names, like Terror Behind the Walls (who is actually a real prison), Howl-O-Scresam, and The House of Shak.
In fact, there are 1 200 Hannes officially recognised in the United States, which generate about $500 of revenue, according to the United States, and this includes these wonderful pictures of you in the process of getting you over that your friends put on Facebook and you cannot take away and on which you like a kind of style that you'll like to leave a comment of the style that is a nice head.
Finally, let us talk about clichés.
Charlie Brown presented us with Le Grose Ciroilles when you were glued, and sculpit a guy in the form of an lane, it's like decorating a Christmas tree. It's something that we have done since we're very small.
Fortunately for us, the trend of the baby-cieriller is only beginning last year thanks to Pinter, so most of us have sculpated these potists and did not have to sit down.
This year, Americans will spend around 106 M in cement, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The shells that drowned softly on your house's pork probably came from Illinois, where 542 million hectolitres were grown this year.
If you seek to point out more, call Tim and Susan Maaisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpate their shells of 922 kg.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create a structure of charity ("bade bank") comprising 38 billion pounds (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet by 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to cleanse it completely within three years.
RBS also said that it would put a provision for depreciation of bad additional debts from four to £4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing linked to the constitution of the capping structure.
RBS also stipulated that this internal restructuring would release 10 to 11 billion capital books, thereby strengthening its ability to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bade bank" would make it possible to draw a line in the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, concern ourselves with the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the United Kingdom", said the new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rays
The interior has seats and belt belts at 6 points, as well as an Intercom system.
Among the options, include improved brakes, a service giving access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, the Director-General of Bowler Motorport said: "The amateurs who join Bowler have changed.
They are not all experienced, some seek excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way of trying to try different forms of rainfall in the United Kingdom and internationally, and to prepare for the guys and realities of raids.
We had a lot of pleasure in developing the vehicle of Defder Challenge, the championship really will be palpable.
In addition, Defder Challenge will propose a training and testing day in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The fire brigade was called to rescue a moot lost after being stuck to 15 m above the ground on an unstable corny in a career.
Ruby, a cocker, escaped after a road accident without gravity.
She was picked up three days later by a person who promised her dog stuck in the career
The fire brigade took off on the cliff to recover the chip and save it from a certain death.
A chiot had the chance to escape the worst after the fire brigade was called to recover safely when he was lost to 15 m above the soil on the volatile season of a cliff.
Ruby, a cocker cocker of 9 months, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his small friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the career of Flapse in Denolm, in the West Yorkshire, to find Rby and thanked the fire and rescue service of West Yorkshire.
They had desperately sought their lost Shia and launched an appeal on social networking sites after it disappeared in the career following an accident without gravity.
Towards 14,15 Wednesday, a person with an acute eye who promoted his dog has repressed Ruby on a corny in the career, stuck to 15 m above the soil.
A technical rescue team of Ceckheaton's fire brigade has been ruined on the scene and descended to save Ruby by using an animal for animals to carry it up to the top of the cliff.
The technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: "It's in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m of the summit and 15 m of the soil.
She didn't budge during the rescue, she was frozen.
But it is going right now.
She has eaten biscuits after.
It was a very unusual appeal.
It's unbelievable that someone noticed the dog.
The technical relief expert Peter Lu said: "Ruby has had a lot of luck to get out of it.
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was conducted in the veterinary surgeon for control; his general state was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, Halifax in the West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by observing the rescue.
First, I didn't think she was there.
It's surprising to have it again in the arm.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and she had evaporated, she would probably have fallen.
The fire brigades have been stunned.
What they did was really courageous.
They are so grateful, each of them has been absolutely fantastic.
Mr Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she fell but she didn't budge."
The fire brigade was super.
I don't think she was there.
Mitk Jagger says he never dreamed Katy Perry when she had 18 years.
During an interview with an Australian radio broadcast this week, the pop declared that it was chorist on the song of Jagger, Old Habitats Die Hard in 2004.
Perry said he didn't have dinner with the rock veteran and explained, he didn't get me when I was 18 years old.
She added, it was a long time ago, and he was very nice.
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70 years old, said that he categorically denies that he made advances to Katry Perry.
The representative added: maybe she confuses him with someone else.
Perry was one of the songs to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, has landed at the first place of charts this week.
Beijing called for a Turkmen Islamic movement
"The support behind the scenes for the attack came from the Islamic Movement of East Turkestan, based in Central and Western Asia," declared the boss of Chinese security bodies to a Hong Kong television station, according to a video online on Thursday evening on an Internet site.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Communist Party of China's Communist Party (CCP), spoke in Tashkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time that a Chinese official wants a special organization after the attack on Monday.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of a same family in the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, a border of several Central Asian countries, have precipitated their car with gasoline gasoline against the entry of the banned City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declares fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, the former name of China's Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 among the organisations affiliated to Al Qaeda.
This movement is often appointed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic disorder in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's breakup gives the choice to Scots
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement to be able to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along the wall of Hadnothing.
While it's true that the newspaper of Strahathyde indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the headlines (and it was predicted to be predicted).
No one has said that the EU Member States spend a lot of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a tiny concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scots.
So it's a story that is not one.
And a history so old that it has now been fiddled: I heard for the first time the bobbard that independence means passport control, more than 40 years ago.
Yet we forgot an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dust dust.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitively stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and removed the Liberal Democratic Party (the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, combined with the straitjacket on national economies through joining the single currency, led many people to think that the Europe Project went too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits. This was only true for Greece.
Rather, the European system has put on its members exchange rates favorable to German exporters what German politicians want to retain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with a productivity problem intrinsic to Germany.
The only recourse is to make drastic cuts in salaries and public expenditure promoted by Berlin.
Beyond current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the green energy policies imposed by Brussels, which are a reason to subsidise French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of the consumer, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is an inhibiting disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All wage gels in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalised by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the grey revolt, especially in France, is one of the great guys of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU to be a means to control Germany and to put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to run out.
As a result: Marine Le Pen's extreme right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the socialists back to power in the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote. It's a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split from the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use the European elections next year to create a single anti-European and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties are good at these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That's what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-euro sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the Europe of the Nations (sovereign) free of charge by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellites could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will turn a blind eye to the United States.
But the growing interest of Washington for the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I think that Scotland could live with a freer European agreement on condition that we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a Europe of non-federal nations.
Otherwise, we should emulate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland's SNP government is a good thing, and it's worth noting the anti-austerity political movement that has succeeded best in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour chessboard, Allistar Darling, and the conservative / Liberal Democrat coalition that followed.
It would be ridiculous now for Scotland to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Beginning: Sex earlier
Studies show that young African-American girls and Hispanics tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Natural change does not mean that the pubery is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys.
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialist journalist in family and health issues in the child.
Does a mother have to worry if the seins and poles of her daughter are beginning to push up to 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics that took place this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr Paul Kabeowitz, sin-endocrine, explained that these early physical changes are pretty common among young American people and represent a new standard.
I spend a lot of time reassuring parents in general, it doesn't indicate a rapid move towards full-bust, said Kabeowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as the bourgeoisation of the seins, the poles under arms and in the purified area and the bosses, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight advance of the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, whereas it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
Once the window has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules emerge, indicated Kabeowitz, also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping. It's a Commonwealth.
Time is the most precise test to know how the puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the real appearance of the puberty, but it is seen as early when the development of the window is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slowes or stops, it's something that a paediater can follow closely.
More rapid development can justify tests carried out by endocrine to remove serious problems such as tumours or kysts.
There are treatments to delay the emergence of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature ageing of the os that can slow down growth and a small size at adult age.
Recommendations on medication and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kabeowitz is cautious with medicines but recognizes that controlling the pubery can mitigate certain behaviors of behavior and sensation for girls to be different from others.
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way in which they manage hygiene issues, declared Kabeowitz.
It was a shock, remember a woman whose daughter had his first rules at 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, it was not prepared emotionally.
She came back from the frightened and upset school to be the first among her friends.
There are lots of theories to public knowledge about the causes of early school.
Yet there is no coherent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kabeowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study carried out on girls aged between 6 and 9, who link the mass fat percentage to the start of the pubery.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In that country, young African-American girls and Hispanics tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
At global level, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, economic conditions for the climate, and the genes.
Another problem: although boys have poles on the face and in the younger purified area, the trend towards a real early school is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acupuncture and funeral poles is commonplace, even in infants and the smallest.
We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of the pubery, said Dr Lawrence Silverman, a sink-endocrine working in hospital for Goryeb children in Morristown, in the New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their paediatricians to know how to talk with their children.
This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned, explained Kabeowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react in general.
The girls whose puberty is early must be reassured that, even when it comes earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The Folk-up of the Coal brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coal brothers, the high price of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the village of 1961 and the crazy music that started just to resonate it, before Bob Dylan's arrival.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose film has just been the subject of a retrospective to the French Fifth Meeting, had missed the gold Palme in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Failing to be able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Marly, Joel and Ethan Coen cast their hands on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the global star pop Justin Timberlake.
In this film filled with humour in which music is a central figure and the songs interpreted in direct terms, Oscar Isaac is proving to be a sizeable musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for crazy music with a jubilation contagion.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich aversion of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the wonderful" for less relaxed clothes, a soft voice when she sits, but the jury debited to the machine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells a week about the tribes of a crazy singer who doesn't get to lose and get bogged down with the entire earth.
It accepts the removal of the replaced substitutes in the studios.
Without housing, he turns the canaries of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, it's what interests us: a mixture of luck, a garlic who is not there at the right time, who is not a career, but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," said to the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prices at Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two film fans of mad music built their story on real figures at the time like the mad musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood in New York called to become "the epicentre of the rise of crazy music that would create international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk, wrote.
The film then picks up documentary material, dust musical music invaded from 33T invented by an old secretary secretary, the music choices of the time and the cafés where the songs were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny personator who crosses the film permanently: a beautiful cat with the crèche, a fortune companion of Llewyn Davis.
Interviewed on how he made his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled "greatness in the Tennessee, baked by the bluge and the cousy."
"My first lessons of music have been given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play the guy," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "chance can also launch someone's career", and "increasingly today."
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop state explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by everything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS," died.
He will never have known the word retirement.
Plenène of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at 83 years, just published his 200th SAS, "The Kremlin's Vengance."
In February, the New York Times devoted it as "the author of spying novels who knew too much."
He was then going to spend ten days in Afghanistan, the scene of 198 and 1994, opoping with the famous series of espionage rods.
Drinking physically by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he was travelling during this trip with a ambulance.
And before Afghanistan, he was also party to Libya, Russia, Lebanon, and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, was unaware of the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, nearly half a century ago.
"Without doubt between 120 and 150 million countries," he was moving forward in March.
His cat Burmese on its knees, in the salon of his immense apartment of a Foch implant at two stages of the Arc of Triumph, the malign eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, he wrote a pound of books on the low table between the bronzes or the reported ivory towers of 130 countries that were hard to locate his novel.
For the price of a cigarette packet, the reader has the right to traditional coverage with the photo of a young woman at the advantageous shower, wearing a pistol or a gun gun.
Internally, his serennial altitude (SAS) Prince Malko Lége, the Austrian aristocratic aristocrat and contracted agent of the CIA to pay for the reparations of the family castle, boils down to the news of all the villains of the earth, communist in the 1970 "s and 1980" s, then jihadists from the 1990 "s.
Every book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exotism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zeste of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literary author," explained Gerard de Villiers.
I regard myself as a contor who writes to distract people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "like the big pre-war papers, like Albert London, who went there and came back with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS said "to make a kind of geopolitical frenzy."
"I'm constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before leaving," adding Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of services whom I know for some for 20 or 30 years.
As a result, many of its SAS are often premonitory: so, a month before the attack on a center of command of the Syrian regime killing several senior officials, he told the story in "Le Chemin de Damascus".
In "Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in that city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he inaugurated the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The plot of Cairo," a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako" he reported the columns of 4X4 of jihadists who were based on the Malian capital.
I'm not stupid, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply put hypotheses from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realised.
After these trips in often troubled areas, he installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM to Marguerite in 1976 "whose spare parts have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected every page in the pen.
At the walls of his office, the AK-47 assault guns, the erotic photos and the photographs of the author with African warlords.
Reflectively tricked for machism by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organisations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always very welcome in Africa where I have very many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, doesn't have an age."
He will not die and will not be retiring.
Nor do I.
Manufacturers quarrel about the breadth of seats while big orders are at stake.
The dispute is raging between the big aviation manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for bitter confrontation at the aeronautical showroom in Dubai, which takes place month after month.
The conflict relates to the width of seats proposed on long-haul flights to passengers of the economic class who are not always the most crowded by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest equipment presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 lens (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing says that it should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out when the aviders sought to sell even larger versions of their long-haul aircraft, hoping possibly a record of orders during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be ready for the back of the plane, in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats, which is essential for the economic performance of the mini-juridico segment.
Boeing declares that its 777X reorganization can be accommodated in economic class 406 people in seats of more than 17 hens, and will be configured with 10 seats per square.
Airbus points out that the competitor's competitor to its A350 will transport 350 people in seats of 18 grammes of broad configuration.
Aircraft giants often exchange coups on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai aeronautics, where 777X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We have been able to see recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people each in the restaurant, entitled "Is you willing to accept this?"
Boeing proposes long-haul flights in smaller seats than in regional turbine aircraft, as John Leathy, the commercial director of Airbus, has indicated.
As eating habits change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970 "s, when the jumbo 747 of Boeing defined the modern long-term trip, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American from 40 to 49 years grew by 10%, according to data from the US Department of Health.
The size of the average American in the 21st century is 39.7 hens, according to American health statistics.
Airbus declares that its rival is cling to a concept of siege that dates back to the 1950 "s, when the flame retardant of the newly named device was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an extra chicken in the size of the seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53%.
Boeing contests the Airbus figures with regard to the size of seats and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that experience in cabin depends not only on the size of the seats.
It really is a question of providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their activities, declared Kent Craver, in charge of passengers' satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what to make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having a certain freedom of movement, but for suppliers it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race to orders for aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 million at the price of the market in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters pointed out for the first time in July, the configuration of seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the most recent appliances.
Airbus and Boeing are both claiming a return per seat in their latest patterns of long-haul motorists 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends partly on the comparison between 777X configurated with 10 seats per row and a model 777 of origin configurated in 9.
The profit in terms of unit costs is low compared to the configurated apparatus with 10 seats currently in service.
Boeing does this in order to be able to fill more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by comparison with our products, said Kevin Keniston, director of Constrong Passer at the European Airbus Airport.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configurated with 10 seats per square in the 777 already suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper tariffs.
A seat width of 18 lens would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the threat of 777. It declared the expert inside the cabin Kirby, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers among which airlines have to choose.
The vendors of aircraft who make the tour of the world even take a meter to check the competing configurations.
While selling to offer comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer planes with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and regional trips.
Airbus offers an A350 configuration with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater personalisation of cabins by offering larger seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the other big manufacturer of big modern appliances, experts say that it's unlikely that his call to the aeronautical industry to put in place a size standard for the seats will be successful, but that he could forget the wave of 777X sales.
The shareholder shareholder irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of shareholder shareholders voted on Thursday against the proposal for remuneration for the founder and director General Larry Ellison, in view of his group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but has tarnished the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just tired of the victory of his ship at the World Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his salary.
The Oracle Pass gave up a bonus of 1.2 million dollars for 2013 closed in May because of the group's bad performance, which missed its growth targets, but it received about $77 million from stock options.
Its fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Out of the overall financial year 2013, the net benefit of Oracle has risen by 3.5% while the stock exchange rate of 27.5%, overperforming the S & P-500 index, which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
Only one dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from addiction to nicotine.
Other tests are needed before starting testing on human beings, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weiler Cornell Medical College of New York said that the first signs were encouraging.
We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods currently available on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches, said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which begins to produce a regular stream of antibodies.
Anti-bodies trump all the nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from having his dose of nicotine.
During tests, the vaccinated mice to whom we subsequently gave the nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mouse who had not been vaccinated were apathetic, said researchers, sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiments are described in the journal Science TransLatin Medicine.
Previous vaccines against tobacco proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so frequently so that antibodies levels remain high that they were too expensive and not practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, we could administer it to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it's more likely that it will be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
They will know that if they start smoking, they're not happy about it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to lose their bad habit, he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but pointed out that much more extensive research was needed.

The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsouth, was killed in a strike by an American drone Friday in Pakistan, has been taught to the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsouth's death has been announced several times in the past.
But officials, the army, and the activist activist have said this time that he lost his life in this strike, carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsouth was killed in a drone strike," said a senior security officer.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, travelling in London, informed the British Government that talks had been started with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies to be influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of South Wales Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state's anti-corruption regulator.
South Wales's former minister, Joe Tripodi, denied that he changed trade policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government controlled by the government.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation to know if Mr Obeid had lobbied several government ministers to renew his balls in Circular Quay, where the Obeid owns two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without there being any invitation to tender.
It now enquiries the allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former deputy Secretary General of Mr Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions begun in 2005, the government pressed for the balls to be subject to a call for tenders.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer times.
In 2009, the balls on Circular-Quay companies, which reported to the Obeid about $2.5 M per year, were renewed without there being any call for tenders.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr Obeid who, acknowledged Mr Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on balls.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed the appeals made in August and September 2007 between Mr Obeid, Mr Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under the orders of Mr Obeid at the Ministry of Fishing.
The subject discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the policy on commercial balls. It asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Wahaly to Mr Tripodi.
No, he replied to Mr Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed but anyway, it was not that.
Certainly not between me and Mr Oeid.
Israeli war planes targeting Syria, declare a responsible person
Israeli war planes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Labekia on Thursday night, confirming a military officer at Fox News.
The person responsible didn't specify what the target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has led air strikes against missiles in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa could have to pass a test of authenticity.
The government is currently studying the possibility of establishing a test of authenticity for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending the repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to fill unskilled posts or as a hijacked way to get his family and friends in Australia.
A government working document has been unveiled today, while Labour MP McKew denounced government discourse on foreign workers, saying that he could offend Australia's neighbors.
The scramble statements on "foreigners returning to the end" and "jobs for the Australians first" are a unpleasant return at the time when unions demanded a protected labor market, he said to the Australian Ina Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the white people had to be protected and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historic arteries.
The working document mentions the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
The Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under examination.
If the criterion of authenticity is adopted, a visa seeker could be checked to know if the job offer is genuine in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned in the company that sponsors it.
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker would have died of a heart attack after having arrived on a ship carrying asylum seekers on the island of Christmas this week.
The starving son of the man, aged 9, went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital in Christmas, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services up to Scotland and the north of England will start from the opening of Pacse 1 in 2026.
The Transport Minister Baroness Kraer said that the project would bring together the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Transport Minister, Keiith Brown, said he was excited about working with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed railway line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England, from 32.7 ££42.6 to £42.6.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scottland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of journeys for the north of England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh from three hours to the most.
Baroness Kraer said: "Our goal for HS2 concerns a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together.
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it's also a question of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Allistar Carmichal, added: "The announcement today is good news for Scotland.
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called Mr Carmichal to support unequivocally the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight into the overall project of high-speed rail networks throughout Great Britain.
So we are excited about working in partnership with the British Government to look at options to get the high-speed train network up to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and supplementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board are currently in force in Australia.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to put their tablets and their smartphones during the takeoff and landing despite the gesture of the United States to relax the regulation on electronic devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their appliances during the critical flight phases, provided they are in the air.
Passengers can already do it for most of the flight, but many people find it hard to get access to their electronic books during takeovers and landing.
Australian carriers look at the decision that obliges US carriers to carry out important work in order to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures in the immediate future.
The Civil Aviation Assurance Authority also said that it looked at the announcement but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices by air, it said.
The issue is the subject of regulation that obliges operators of aircraft to guarantee the maintenance of permanent safety and passengers to comply with the safety precautions provided by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about its intention to extend the use of its entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said that it would follow the regulator.
We would welcome a revision of the CASA which would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the customer's experience now that we have (the system of entertainment on board using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft, indicated a spokesman.
Qansas said that it was respecting the current rules at the moment.
In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change this in the immediate future, she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the decision of the FAA and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleets.
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing textbooks, training equipment, the transport of hand luggage and the instructions provided to passengers.
As soon as an airline verified the tolerance of its fleet, it could allow passengers to use light mobile devices, such as tablets, electronic books and smarmphonies to all the altitudes, declared FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to switch their appliances during the landing.
The group also recommended that more heavy equipment should be safe under the seats or in higher compartments during the takeoff and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent baggage
The small municipality of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday evening.
Three vehicles of gendarmerie, two ambulances and a hole of 30 people according to the testimonies collected...
On the day of Hallween, the evening has been agitated on the side of Pia where a rie involving several people has broken out on the Post.
Four light wounded at least would be deplorable.
Alternatively, the policemen went there to separate the warring parties and ensure that the injured were taken care of.
Singapore's deposit lenders benefit from the middle classes forced to tighten their belts.
You're a lender of the commercial center of Bendemer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga put a brake, a joke and a pair of gold bucks to pay for the school fees of his girls.
My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money has gone in, says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although she won $3 000 from Singapore ($2 400) per month as a feminist and her husband works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in parts of Southeast Asia, where household indebtedness increases the fact that ValuedMax, where she has carried out her transaction, has become the third loan company this week to be introduced on the Singapore stock exchange.
Meeting jewels is not only a quick way of obtaining cash from $1 300 in Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga, but it's almost as cheap as non-guaranteed bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledge lenders raise an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United States Overseas Bank, a local fund provider with a branch in the same commercial center.
But donor lenders have the advantage of not asking for solvency or of salary evidence, and can unblock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to the lenders on the back, while families feel the pressure that increases the cost of living and the overindebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fuelled by a monetary policy that is too lax in advanced economies, low and middle income families turn to lenders on loan to fill the difference while their economies suffer a slowdown.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poori cited the growing indebtedness of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded the debt ratio of the highest household / gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia comes at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while this rate was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a steady decline in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or low [wage ladder] seek to supplement their income as they can, declare Song Seng Wone, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the last two years have meant that people have been quick to put their personal effects in order to touch the value in the species of their jewels.
In Singapore, about 70% of the articles released in the 200 loan shops on the guarantee of the city are gold.
People say, the price of gold is high, let us put the gold chain in the grandmother and we will return to it next month.
In Thailand, the biggest provider of lending on deposit, Easymoney, recorded a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in the last few months.
The increase is such in the lending sector on the guarantee that ValuedMax, the company operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this in Singapore, is planning to develop not only in neighboring Malaysia where he already has four shops but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, his Director General.
The company will finance them by using 60% of the $66 m of Singapore that it raised this week when it was introduced on the Singapore stock exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have suffered criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that the deposit offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but that, in addition, it does not directly increase debt.
Customers are mortgaging the goods they already possess, and the fact that they monetize their personal assets does not increase household debt, says it.
Implementation is better socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term.
People who go to the lenders on the deposit are not just those who have financial problems.
The well-off people of Singapore also go to the loan shops on the promise of ValuedMax to bring about gold lords or Rolex monsters, who can represent up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We see customers of all sections of society.
It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for commercial activities or investments, or small companies that have cash needs to get a difficult course, adding Miss Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pasteur accused of juvenile pornography in New Scotland
A boss who cares about young people, in the region of Halifax in New Scotland, is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30 years old, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and the Office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the boss was unofficial, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a communiqué, church officials indicate that Mr Hudgins resigned from his post.
The carrier has been released under conditions.
It must not, in particular, communicate with people under 18 years old and not access the Internet.
It will appear in provincial court, in Halifax, in December.
He travels to Nazi uniformity in the supermarket, before being driven out of it.
A man who was dressed with a Nazi uniform barracks of a breward with the gamy cross was asked to leave an English supermarket. Customers complained to the head of the establishment who called the police, indicated the shop on Friday.
"We have received several complaints from clients, so we asked him to leave the shop", explained a spokesperson for the supermarket chain.
The magazine called the police to the rescue, but "the time it arrives, he was already left without espionage," he added.
I was queuing when I saw a woman who seemed to be upset.
People were outspoken.
"You don't get out in the street unless you want to attract attention," testified a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, in the newspaper Cambridge News.
This incident took place on Thursday, day of the Hallween party, where it's customary to disguise itself in monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a channel.
A man of Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I'm wearing a black sister twice a week for three years in Asda," said Paul Duutton, explaining "mental problems."
$325 million rescue plan for the Tasmanmania health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 bailout package for the vaguely health system is accompanied by strict conditions to ensure that the government government will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that the Commonwealth is now taking urgent action to put an end to a crisis caused by the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic illness and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after consultations with the government with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
The government has proposed an emergency rescue package which, in our opinion, will solve the unique difficulties facing the state, said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 Plan includes a $31 / $31 campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
2 600 additional operations, especially in the area of orthopaque surgery and the cataract, will help to catch up.
Funds are also planned for clinics without appointments to Hobart and Launelcon, better external care, training of medical frameworks, services dedicated to mental health and the deployment of electronic medical records in local hospitals.
These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first line clinics, this is the best way to cure the health system of Tasmania, which Mrs Plibersek said.
The Minister said that the government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict regime of preparation for reports and the surrender of accounts.
The state will have to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it spends additional funds.
A committee composed of three people will be set up to ensure that the state provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 m will not count for much unless they are followed by a real reform that strengthens the public health system of Tasmania.
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent help he presented to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
I hope that the federal aid plan will make a major contribution to removing the public health system from Tasmania from the blacklist, which Mr Wilkie said.
According to the government government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But the opposition spokesperson for the health opposition Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is a "fortune solution."
The reason we are here is that the State Labour Government withdrew 430 M from its health system, he said on ABC TV.
You cannot have a government government that commands almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 m, and pretend that it's a good day.
Mr Duutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a careful recovery of time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Speaking in France of the 1760 "s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent in a nursery by his family.
When she rebel, she faces the ruthless cruelty of a Manta Sudre, deliberately sadistic, and becoming a subject of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pays in glaciousness or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious nature of the narrative could also become a pensioner for the public.
Syria destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, says the supervisory body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions full of toxic gas, declared the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also declared on Thursday that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the banning of chemical weapons (OIC) arrived with one day ahead of the deadline.
1 November set by the organisation based in The Hague ordering Damascus to destroy or make unusable all the chemical weapons production units and machinery to mix toxic gases and to fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start the destruction of weapons and existing reserves.
It is estimated that the country has approximately 1 000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sardin.
The announcement was made while the fighting was raging on Thursday in the city of Safira which, according to experts, is home to a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, reported the Syrian Centre for Human Rights based in Britain.
The group of militants, following developments in the human balance thanks to a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120 296 people were dead.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61 civilian 67, including 6 365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29 954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces found the death, including 18 678 were fighters of pro-government forces and 187 activists from Lebanese Hezbollah.
Among the deaths, it is also estimated that 2 202 were deserters and some 5 375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100 000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops are fighting against the rebels, many of whom are linked to Al Qaeda groups, to Safira for weeks.
The Centre said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fighting has highlighted the importance of the dangers facing chemical weapons inspectors when they have to complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a civil war that continues, within tight deadlines.
A statement by the OIC, which works in close collaboration with the UN, indicated that its team was now satisfied with having controlled and seen the destruction of all the critical production declared and the machinery for mixing and filling it.
She added that there was no other inspection activity at the moment.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were not able to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, indicated the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OIC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the unity of Safira was one of the two sites that the OIC inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for total destruction of its chemical weapons that was approved the month following the Executive Committee of the OIC.
I salute the moral strength and the courage that you all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organisation, declared the Director-General of the organisation Ahmet Uzumu, in a comment published by the OIC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of Assad and his security forces, who are supported by members of the alaelite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Monitoring Centre on Human Rights said that there was a sharp explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Man caused by the sentence handed down against one of the bomb posters in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence passed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shooted by a pack of execution.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing by being one of the most sought-after men in Southeast Asia, yesterday was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in manufacturing explosive machinery used during attacks.
He could be released after 15 years under conditional liberation.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the deaths of 202 people, 88 Australians, and caused many injured.
He has also been convicted of many other charges in connection with terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors asked for a sentence of imprisonment, but they could have asked for man, called "Demand Man," for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for Ja Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost his two twins 39 years ago, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction carried out by Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
He should be dragged before the executing of the execution, said Mrs Corteen to the APP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, nor see my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a groceries from outside, exploded just after 23 hours on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy" s Bar when a suicide bomber was able to salvage a sack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank in the coma after the attack and stayed unconscious for a month, and he died three times while he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should have had the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the carnage in Amrozi, Muklas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Maintaining it in life, why, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Passing 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injured hundreds of others, it's not a lot.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces kill former Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an agent of the FBI said that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing links between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
He didn't go to himself, added Mrs Corteen.
Until recently, he made a mockery of the grief he had been able to cause to other people.
The verdict was made on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
There will be lots of platitudes this year, Mrs Corteen.
However, Patek can appeal for his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not pass an appeal with their mobile phones)
Passengers "passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music, but not talk about their mobile phone in accordance with the new, very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which change will be put in place will vary from one airline to another, declared the administrator of the FAA Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated training manuals for crew members and rules on the accommodation of appliances to be in conformity.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to extend the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
On the basis of the plan, we could approve an extended use of electronic devices very soon, which indicated the FAA in a statement.
At present, passengers must switch their smartphones, tablets and other appliances as soon as the doors of the plane are closed.
They are not supposed to rally them before the plane reaches an altitude of 10 000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to extinguish their appliances during the plane's descent before the landing and not to rash them until the plane has been set up.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use their equipment during takeovers, landings and the rolling wheel, declared FAA.
Most new airplanes and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi to higher altitudes, should meet the criteria.
Lwill Glading, the president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenders, has been happy with these changes.
Once the new policy is implemented safely and we are going to work closely with the carriers for this, it will benefit everyone, explained Glading in a statement.
We are, frankly, tired of feeling like watchdogs in the room when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet for surfing, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10 000 feet, declared the agency.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft on aircraft.
So, still not Words With Friends, the online game-style game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled to a high degree from an American Airlines plane after refusing to extinguish his appliance while the aircraft was kept at the door.
And heavier appliances like laptops will always have to be kept because they could injure someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory power on mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communication Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA can lift the ban on certain electronic devices during the takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Corporation Safe Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always regarded as posing a risk.
Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone networks if they are used on board, declared Rosenker.
An industrial advisory committee created by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorises a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased over recent years to relax restrictions on their use.
Critics like Senator Claire McCastle, D-Mo, argue that there are no valid safety grounds for these bans.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of appliances has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget about switching their appliances, or deliberately doing it.
The FAA started to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying radios FM, the high-tech gadget of the then.
New online aircraft rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi to cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified planes to host Wi-Fi systems are also better resisting interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow for the wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, declared Huerta.
Today's electronic devices typically emit radio broadcasts that are much lower than previous generations of appliances.
Electronic books, for example, only emit minimum transmissions when you turn a page.
But transmissions are stronger when download equipment or send data.
Amaz.com is among those who lobby for relaxing restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the leaders of the company commissioned a line of online readers of electronic books Kindle and steered it to see if there were problems, but there were none.
This inspired members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA of mixed feelings about whether or not the use of appliances presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passers said he thought that interference from appliances was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee have said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots who indicate that appliances can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorise pilots to ask passengers to switch their appliances during landing to instruments under conditions of low visibility.
A group of the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for arrangements full of common sense for people with technology.
We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security, said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A Blinded bird of a platform in the North Sea has been released in nature
A bird, helicopter after having been found on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released in nature.
The rally of water was raised on board a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before he was handed over by Scottish SPCA in his Alla rescue centre.
The director of the center, Colin Seddon, said: "This rank of water was probably a hiring migratory source that came from northern Europe and found itself caught in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.
It seems that the exhausted bird would have succeeded in finding refuge on the oil platform.
He added: he was unable to get bogged down again, so we were contacted to help.
The water rally was healthy when he was released.
Is the European elite prepared to do business with Britain?
The Business for Brittan campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring together companies and to define what the creators of wealth and jobs want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most complete investigation with British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGoogle questioned more than 1 000 entrepreneurs, generally representative of all the business sizes, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We discovered that the vast majority of companies now seek to export outside Europe, focusing on the countries that modernise and develop while the EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcane.
When asked their opinion on specific political points, ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws, the majority of entrepreneurs think that control of these key competences should go back to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits that there is to be part of the European trade area 40% of large, traditionally the most pro-European companies even agree.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain continue the initiatives for a change in the Treaty and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all the large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a significant change that replaces power in the United Kingdom.
The stakes are high, so that we can change the Treaty and better represent Britain's interests would allow a 16% shift in votes in favor of maintaining the country in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt one moment: this investigation shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be employment and growth in Great Britain and, as the findings of our investigation show, for businesses it means putting new emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
The United States of Hallween
In the United States, President Obama didn't deviate from the tradition of Hallween.
With his wife, last night he distributed fridges to hundreds of children invited in the White House jargon in Washington.
Last year, Hallween's celebrations on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled because of the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the celebrations have caught up.
In New York, thousands of cooked people participated in the parade organised in the "Greenwich village" neighborhood.
Everyone is excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put the costumes I had planned last year.
You're being treated like crazy, adding Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's good child, it's cool.
We really need this.
Hallween is a celebration celebration celebrated on the eve of the Tower, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says that the gas pipeline in Bulgaria augurs a new era of gas
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's biggest energy projects, declared the director of Gazprom.
A historic event took place today: construction started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the large-scale project of Europe as a whole, explained Alexei Miller, the Director-General of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the whole continent of Europe.
South Stream should allow diversification of Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart in Ukraine, a country through which the largest part of Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk relative to conventional routes, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated forever.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced tariff as soon as the whole project is launched in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairen wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced on Thursday the New Year of Tahii, containing news of Radio Australia.
This island, in the east of the Gamer Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, half way between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutilations of the Boutty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, most of them descendants of the maimed of the Bouty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2, which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
Setting up such a marine reserve would allow the UK to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that they have the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or several aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where military surveillance vessels are placed.
As for France, it already has to lead the very expensive air and sea surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia ZEEE, a neighbour of Pitcairn.
The FAA relaxes restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft, but it will always be forbidden to pass calls on mobile phones.

Prison for life for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, in the north-east of China, was sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having affected more than 19 million yuans of bribes, reporting the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of the Bank of Jiin, a public establishment, helped companies and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotion in exchange for money or gifts, declared the first interim court in Beijing on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office in March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" that with "mosques" - subalternate officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former executives of oil giant Petrochia.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after serving the highest functions within the state.
But the government has not shown any intention to reform the system of fighting corruption by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assaults following allegations made against Jonathan Lord, at a hearing of the royal Commission.
Two YMCA employees of South Wales have been accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbach, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing of the royal Commission charged with sexual abuse on children.
But in his opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA said that it had never had to deal with a problem of sexual aggression on children in its organisation.
Director General Phillip Hre was questioned about two cases: an employee of the YMCA was accused of offences relating to child pornography and a physical educator of the YMCA Caringbach Hall was convicted of sexual assaults on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr Hare said to Gail Furness, a lawyer adviser to the Commission, that he had had knowledge of the first case but he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the opening declaration of the YMCA was inaccurate by underlining, the external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organisation.
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the seconds worst appreciated on four establishments during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communications carried out in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who started working in the YMA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with the recruitment of Lord and that he had omitted to check that employees knew they were obliged to report any breach of child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years in which he worked in the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a sentence of 6 years in prison.
But Mr Hare rejected the idea that the YMA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings to the safety of children.
The staff testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord stayed alone with children, that he kept them in private, put them on his knees, told them that he loved and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was surrounded by Lord and who asked for training in child protection because she was worried about her behavior, indicated that she found the child care officer of YMCA Caringbah, Jachar Barnat, who would encapsulate Lord, who is very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.
The Director-General said he rejected the testimonies of the staff according to which they were reluctant to point out these shortcomings to their hierarchical superiors.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations that they maintained with Lord have blurred their judgment, which means that they didn't signify his actions.
Mr Hare said he had expressed his view before the YMCA council of South Wales saying that, for the organisation, the lesson learned from the incident Jonathan Lord should not be about the reporting by the staff, and the advice was in agreement with him.
Mr Hare said that the decision to sign the staff of confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations have been made, was taken by the Director General of the YMA responsible for child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of evidence but that it was an excess of zeal and that it had been poorly implemented.
South Wales's YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He indicated that there were serious problems in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister, but recognize that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old man made his views known about various national policies.
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as special envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked him if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have replied, according to the Evening Standard London: Yes, of course, but he can probably happen, so...
When many experts in the street protests met in Cardiff to confront and win the throne of the year, they knew that competition would be rude.
But no one expected to win Fenon Kirchester, a three-year-old child.
Not yet in school and only a few months after having done its first weapons, the tiny and its Shetland Teney pony have trotted out during the three rounds with a great ease and won the first prize, leaving the 30 other adult competitors behind them.
The two inseparable things that are of the same size have been welcomed for presentation, attitude and style during the annual contest that took place at the center of Sunnybank, Rudy near Cardiff.
Opposing against men and women in elegant shepherds, he was wearing his flat hat on the side in a discontracted way to discount his two-year-old Toffée pony around the runway.
Menrad was praised by judges for his natural qualities of uncommon design for a child of his age.
And Toffe received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Open had Toffe in present for his 3rd birthday last March and has been going on since his Shetland pony every day.
His mother Donna, 30 years old, said: "Honon and Toffe are doing an excellent job.
They have presented themselves with and against all, but both have flowed the gold cut and the rocket.
It's only the second time that he was playing with Toffe and we were crazy for him to have won.
On the pist, people who didn't know it thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take photographs with him.
This young boy, the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbow Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the traces of his giant Sharon Hellls, who has been involved in quiet competitions for more than 10 years.
Mrs Hellells said: there was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it.
He traveled all the length of the runway and even if he seemed to be tiny, he did a wonderful job.
Open is crazy of animals. He admits horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he deals with.
From the way he started, he will certainly be taking part in the demonstration of the year of the year, and I am sure he will make a good job.
A spokesperson for the annual questionnaire has said: "We're only 3 years old but he knows how to conduct his pony.
They form a good team.
Judges have noticed that Fenon and Toffée were well and the way they marched on the runway.
They are looking for effective team work between the pony and the teacher, Mr Fouron and Mr Toffée have been the best on the runway.
I am sure his fine clothes helped Mr Menon, he really was proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched an appeal is going to be reworked.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reworked, declare a regulator of the press.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on TV that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public company.
Now the New Express is going to undergo a complete overhaul, said the regulator.
The order of business comes from the administration of Guangddon for Presse and Exdition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, published a number of incorrect articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
The drafting of New Express was disorganized, said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided to impose an administrative penalty in Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into those responsible in New Express and immediately revisit the management team of the newspaper.
Mr Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of shipyard equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published on two occasions an appeal on the first page for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted that he had published false stories against money.
In this case, I damaged Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to win public confidence, he said to the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and celebrities.
I realised my mistake.
Following the apology of Mr Chen, New Express published his apology on the first page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television documents.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to do their own thing, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year banning the authorities forcing anyone to blame themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is back.
The leaking of radioactive steam detected on one of the two nuclear heaters of Charles-de Gaulle, in mid-October, and while the ship was at sea, was "safe for the sailors", but it's not without consequences for the Marine.
The Royal has indeed confirmed to us "the inavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take appropriate corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the DCNS company, a naval specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, who are dispatched in the Var for the occasion, "are intervening on the aircraft carrier."
It is for them, among other things, to change an apppe on the failing heat.
"Everything is being done to ensure that Charles de Gaulle can make his planned deployment at the end of 2013", but he explains DCNS.
And the National Marine to certify that "it's not in any way challenging the ship's activity program" with nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle comes from an interim period of six months.
He used Toulon in mid-October for training.
In particular, in order to qualify the young hunting pilots.
A "small conflagration", confined to the space containment space, had then occurred on the amateur ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a lot of dissatisfaction on the part of the people I encounter: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a flood of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs that are not going to end.
In short, siphoning off our pockets.
Millions of dollars will be saved in order to allow a tax that is much respectful of those who pay.
Any money taken away from taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Sawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, we don't care about somptuous spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: a deficient cultural center, a strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they sell them to private companies or they can be demolished.
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to the tax payers?
It's not up to public pastors to invest in such companies, but to the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens have been happy to learn that the lakes in the Fisheries and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (major water users) and the huge decline of the population, the use of water has fallen considerably across the territory.
Without wanting to waste it, the city will never miss water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly watered down.
In short, it's easy to achieve big things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer able to buy a pen without passing through a borrowing regulation.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by festivals with beautiful degrees for most, and I don't believe that a sheep farmer is doing worse.
Open of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway route
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own systems of lighting, ventilation and electric rails, has been discovered.
The US authorities described the G4-foot tunnel by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length of nearly six long football fields, links warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, in the United States.
The area is full of indefinite warehouses, which makes it easy to conceal drug-dealing trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs came out of it, they declared the authorities.
The authorities seized 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with the possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intention of selling.
They run a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are convicted.
In Nogales, in Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in the centre of Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage from around 700 yards fitted with railway channels that were leaking from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses San Diego.
The British police are issuing an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police have today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who refugee at the Ecuador of Ecuador in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said that she had issued an opinion of surrender against Australian 40 years, asking her to come to a police police officer, adding that if he didn't do it, he could be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible channels under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he lodged against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm allows its transfer to the United States, it found refuge in the Ecuador Ambassador in London on 19 June, asking this country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has issued an opinion of surrender to a 40-year-old man who asks him to present himself to a police station, on the date and time of his choice, said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under bail.
The Ambassador refused to comment on issuing the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, having unveiled more than 250 000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics will invade our lives
Finn the words to taper for access to his sporphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognised by biometric captors of telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Managing Director of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometrics will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person performing transactions in a world that is as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organisations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this congestion for biometrics, but they worry about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission on Information and Freedoms authorised 774 systems for recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the infeeble network of hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and wherever", "moved to Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to make new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the bypass of the hand and the infeuding network of the breaks or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work on concrete have the very fingers, and their fingerprints are illegible", "Philippe Robin, the technical director of the identity field in Thales Communications & Securiity.
And the collection and verification of the infeuding network and the hand of the hand imply a voluntary and precise gesture of people.
It's both security - we cannot capture these data at their inner circle - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for some 20 years on other approaches, such as recognition of the face or the iris (the coloured part of the eye).
Thanks to the increase in the accuracy of the captors and the ability to compute computers necessary for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten in the last five years, calculating Cyrile Bataller, director of R & D laboratories in Accension in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It's now possible to identify a face or an iris on the move.
"Today, we are carrying out research on the recognition of the voice or the way to walk with the help of sensors, but there needs to be a silent environment," says Sridar Iyengar, director of security research in Intel Labs.
A unique and infallible Marquator, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be regarded as the ultimate biometric data", confirm Sophia Vulliet-Teak, director of studies, innovation and the prospectus in CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police a worth of EUR 90,000 to analyse samples of DNA in the place of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics spread into two groups: identification (recognising one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the one she claims to be).
The identification concerned so far the issuing of identity papers: we need to confront biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) with the information that the state has on all the citizens who have already been fiddled.
This helps ensure that someone does not try to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison can have other applications.
NEC therefore proposes the recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or a shop.
"We recoup the images of the supervisory cameras and compare them to the photographs of celebrities circulating freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible, at NEC France, for commercial development for biometric identifiers.
Another use: to take a photo to photo a queen who queues in a shop, to follow his progress through facial recognition and to calculate the waiting times.
authentication concerned the departure of physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening up a computer).
Added to that, more recently, control control.
"A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the Coptic that points to another", justifying Cyrile Batchater, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those carried out from appliances connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing its card and by putting its hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the banner of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested at Villenne-de Ascq and Angaitself by the Natural Security Society in partnership with banks and teachers of the big distribution: when paying in shop with its banking card, the customer doesn't tap his code, but he put his finger in a reader who scanns the veins.
The experiment is planned for last six months.
If it is successful, the biometric readers could soon reach the French traders.
Steps to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains in cash 30 seconds less, it's good", explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalised services: in a few years, a vocal server can recognise your voice and propose tailor-made options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"fingerprints are stored on a first server." The identities of people are in a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure boy, who is blocking if you try to move it "," Philippe Robin, Thales.
But, because there are no detailed studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The specialists in the protection of privacy, they continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of supervisory cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Piacsa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick, of the Commission's private privacy commissioner.
A driver travelling at 210 km / h with a hot drink between legs has been given an amalgam of £1 000.
A car driver was fined £1 000 for having rushed to 210 km / h with a hot drink that was put in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years from Tiptree in Essex, was repressed leading his Mercedes Benz on the A120 height of Brainmee on 27 May.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the beverage to take between his legs.
At the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the breach of conduct without the prudence and attention required.
The seven points withdrawn on his permit led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie has also been sentenced to pay costs amounting to £90 and a surcharge for the victim of 100 pounds.
A tax on foreign property owners to break the London bubble
The Treasury provisionally calculated the measure of tax on capital gains but waiting for a final decision by Mr Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, put a 7% right of stamp for properties costing more than 2 £, and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a society rather than individually.
The right of stamp already applies to residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708 MP on the tax exercise 2012 / 13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest and the Yorkshire region and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: following the increase in the right of stamp on properties of high value and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to move forward that high value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.
But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or the current homeowners reluctant to sell, he added.
Pre-prestige building works between 5% and 10% of the highest prices of the housing market, in the prosperous sector in the south-west of London that stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record percentage of 11.8% over the last year.
Prices in the center of London show steady growth year by year of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by an internal market that is growing in growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted the way in which movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood.
Previous studies revealed that happy dogs won more their queue to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while the nervous dogs won him more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and answer them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientists of the University of Trirene, said: "Everyone knows that, in man, the left side and the right of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimuli that raise positive or negative emotions.
Here we have tried to see what it was in other species.
He added that, as at home, at dogs the brain's right was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To know more about how dogs react to the messy tail movements of other dogs, researchers have followed animals looking at films where other dogs were.
They have measured the cardiac frequency of animals and analysed their behaviour.
It's surely not long before we understand why their queue sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs of films where other dogs were, either a naturalist version or a sizehete to avoid any further confusion, and we were able to manipulate the tail movement and present it as going more on the left or on the right.
When the animals saw a dog without an expression to win the queue to the right (from the point of view of the dog who wins the queue), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they picked up a quid pro quo mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog who wouldn't get the tail), their heart frequency accelerated and they had an anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating between them thanks to these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet on several occasions other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their queue to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the law side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience.
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and addicts to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The expert in behavior John Bradshaw, a professor invited to the College of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, made it clear that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University found that dogs turned the head to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "The dogs go more easily to a robot dog when his tail wouldn't go to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anonymous, the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of films or robot dogs like dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
Although many elements, raised in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified and dogs are no exception, he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will surely not take long before we understand why their queue sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arc Monkeys is wearing a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The group of rock Arc Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after a lacket has been diagnosed to his singer.
The Swiefeld group was due to take place on Friday in the concert concert The Hydroo in the centre.
However, his lynch forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to postpone a concert to the LG Arena of Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Artic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena de Birmingham this evening and after asking for medical advice, the Arc Monkeys must also postpone the spectacle to the Hydrome de Glasgow on Friday 1 November.
Alex Turner suffers from a layyngitis and regrets that he cannot happen in concert.
The spectacle at LG Arena of Birmingham will take place on 20 November and that at the Hydrome de Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We want to apologise to all the ticket holders for any discomfort caused.
Thank you for contacting the customer service to the ticket where you bought your tickets for any additional assistance.
Pope François will name his first dinners in February
Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the men of the highest church in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so François will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals at present.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a Pope, so it amounts to a group of 120 Cardinal voters.
In a statement announcing the news, Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinings would take place before the ceremony during which bishops will be raised to the dignity of Cardinal, known as conspiracy.
The Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the conspiracy February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of Cardinal players in different parts of the world, declared Lombardi.
Jack Valalo of Catholics said that by February the number of voters will probably have fallen.
He said that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinals as he needed to get the number of voters to reach 120 and so many cardinals over 80 years old he wanted.
The conspiracy of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and especially Italy.
It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will name cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance, he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinal cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world charged with examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on his own.
Now, François chose these eight cardinals to help him help him, explained Valalo.
He added that it was entirely possible for François to ask for advice.
But we never experienced such a situation, it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the paves typically raised bishops representing large communities at the rank of Cardinal, but François was full of surprises, so we don't know who he will name.
GM recalls some of its new pipes in the United States to repair the file file
General Motors Co recalls almost 19 000 of his brand new pickarmers Chevroland Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to settle a problem with the dossiers that are ineligible manually, according to a statement on Friday by the American body responsible for regulating vehicle safety.
On some pickupps, the seats before could present a defect at the level of the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the files do not comply with the federal safety standards of vehicles with regard to support for animals.
If the vehicle is permeated by the back, it may well be that the head does not adequately protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury, according to the statement made on the site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTRSA).
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pipes started in June and represents the launch of the most important vehicles for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM briefed the owners of the default pipes in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to examine the letter of information to owners because of the 16-day ruling of government activities, which slowed down the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of pickupps Silverado and Sierra, which were redrawn for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, declared GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickupps Silverado and 16 503 pickubps Sierra.
GM stock prices rose by 1.4% to reach $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies entanglei under concrete blocks.
A construction worker died in dozens of concrete blocks, on Thursday afternoon, in Montreal.
The drama came to 11 hours, on the street Marquette, near the intersection of the street Beautiful, in the district of Rosema-La Petite-Patrie.
In all probability, work carried out on the foundations was taking place there for some time.
A royalist foundation wall had just been erected over the last few days.
The accident occurred at a time when the victim had arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I went to car and saw the wall collapse with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the site.
I'm landed and I went to remove the big bricks who would recover it.
We saw only part of her back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in the 50 who worked for a coffers company.
Rereviving manoeuvres have been attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
A inspector of the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was sent to the places to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts with the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obliventionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the attacks on drones
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathanel P. Morris is studying in 2nd year of medicine at Harvard medicine.
I am reading a sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me during the morale of the 2nd year of medicine and would give me hope.
It is called The Audaciity to Win, and these are the memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I don't care, this book brings me back at the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut you off.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and the presenters of news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cry joy and my parents have kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries went to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before his post office in 2008, he had 82% of favorable opinions.
And then I farm the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like getting out of a dream.
It's difficult to remember these days full of optimism, it's like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
Change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I put Obama's credit to Obama for great achievements, since the passage from the Affordable Care Act (law on affordable care) to the departure of Iraq from our army, through the end of the story, neither seen nor known, and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantánamo, among other things.
But, having repeatedly defended Obama's administration vis-à-vis my peers and my colleagues, I don't have any explanation.
I am on the edge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the tapping of foreign leaders, or attacks by innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the Americans, or the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the misdeeds of the government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the exceeding of authorised expenditure during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media to silence are the more aggressive ones... since the administration of Nixon.
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the law on the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that is what I expected.
If, at 18 years, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that take place by chance, like the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what disturbs me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would deliver the promises that we heard about for so long.
But, while the favorable opinion index has plunged under 45% this week, it's even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
I do not like the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has suffered huge losses for Clinton to the Primayvania Primayors.
At a post-campaign meeting he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
I want us to focus on our talent, he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathanel Morris.
On Friday, at 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place from Retina to Flélon.
The late, Jonathan, 26 years, Flélon, did not have a cascade.
Despite rapid relief, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
The billionaire Member Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his girls could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining-mining tycoon, which denies the payment of a carbon tax of $6 m, has argued this argument to try to remove questions about a possible conflict.
The Palmer University Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr Abbott's girls were prepared to benefit personally from these policies.
It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of its girls is pregnant, it will have a direct interest in the fact that it obtains a leave, Mr Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr Palmer put forward the idea of a reshuffle of the system of rubbish in order to speed up the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Francis and Bridglet.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
We need a better system, he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, seize your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6.30 p.m. the next morning?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of paper bases to mark the ballot papers.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a paper paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied possible options with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59 years old, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions very seriously.
The exercise of public functions is a question of public service.
We don't seek reward, except for the reward of history because we need to serve the community at a critical time, he added.
A biologist team led by the Wildlife Society Society in New York identified a new type of dauphin with bosses off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaux Bopenoux, charged with scientific mission to the Monitoring Centre for the Conservation and Exclusion of Anieves and Mires Marins (OCEMMM), is for the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new type of dolphin dolphin surprise you?
It's good news, but it doesn't surprise me particularly.
If, in the past, species have been described and identified on the basis of morphlogical, anatomic and geographical, today, the development of new tools such as genetics enables us to improve our knowledge in science classification sciences.
Moreover, it's not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a kind, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on the moral differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are called into question because of the progress of genetics.
Similarly, two species very close to morphlogically were distinguished by genetic engineering.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognised two species belonging to this sub-family: the Pacific bosses and the whales of the Atlantic.
The recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is it an important discovery as the Wildlife Conservation Society said?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population had already been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only there.
So if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental catch occurs in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a species more widely spread on Earth.
This loss of genetic inheritance would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered according to the number of people on Earth, that is to say the stock, and the possibility that it can recover from neighbouring stocks.
With regard to the Santa Hellenic species, whose population of the new discovered species is coming, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located high on the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats where there are many genetic exchanges between people and individuals.
This breed of genes restricts the creation of new species.
On the contrary, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually create new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
We prefer to send robots on Mars, to know what lives in Mariannes, just 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it's high time that it changed.
RBS suspended two traders on the exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its exchange-rate division according to two sources close to the dossier. This shows once again that the global survey of regulators on suspicions of manipulation of the currency market begins to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, especially UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations into the most important financial market in the world, where USD 5.3 trillion is changing hand every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of the manipulation of the interbank rate Libre.
The bank, which refused to comment on suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from regulators.
The ongoing investigation on this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and the other regulators, said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file said that RBS had transmitted files and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, the British regulator, the Financial Contact Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his post as European manager of the cash exchange rate in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European responsible for exchange-rate trading in Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, the seniority of currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders has been charged with charges.
The case of Mr Usher included instant messages sent to and by bankers working in Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said he investigated suspicions of manipulations of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities have the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, to examine allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate rates on the exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, have indicated sources close to the file.
The banks follow the instant messages and the emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment banks in the last few years, but which has been called into question this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to minimize the case by saying that it's almost impossible to manipulate the vast liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost.
The news came on the very day when the Crégé Switzerland announced that it had sent a trader working in his office of funds traded the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of 6 M at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled, indicated a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation of Mayor Rob Ford has been blocked, supports a lawyer
After the police had confirmed that they had put their hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford fun from the crack, Me Clayton Ruby supported never seeing an "so-called" investigation.
Me Ruby said to believe in Presse Canadians that the police had "ignored or minimized" evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, the police arrested the occasional friend and driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion in relation to video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police have said that they also observed this man issuing the collates at Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Me Ruby called "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched the vehicle of Rob Ford or his home, or to listen to his phone, arguing that the police chief Bill Blair chose to be informed about not acting against the mayor.
According to the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could have intercepted the vehicle of Rob Ford, arrested the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a mandate.
It could also have called for an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police officer didn't start, but his spokesman Mark Pugh called the words of Me Ruby "a clear and desperate attempt" to press the media in a case that does not affect him in any way.
In the press conference, Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could be "reasonable grounds" that could lead to a criminal accusation against the mayor.
European stock exchanges in mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are falling on Friday in mid-session, overshadowed by some news of disappointing companies, while Wall Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious because they believe that the US Federal Reserve could end its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
Conversely, after inflation announces at 0.7% for the eurozone as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street foreshadows an opening of US actions on the increase, after two consecutive consecutive sessions.
To the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest retrenchment of CAC 40, overshadowed by the warning about its partner Nissan Moitor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, having also published downside results this morning and announced the internal creation of a charity structure ("bade bank") comprising 38 billion of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafa (+ 2.45%) keeps at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that AT & T study a possible takeover bid.
In the exchange market, speculations about the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy are going well, as John Hardy testifies, strategist in Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for falling the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its retreat against the American currency and has affected in the sitting a further two weeks at 1.3517 dollar.
These same conjectures support the eurozone bond market in reverse.
The Supreme Court validates the Obama administration's reform law
Great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court said today that the reform law of the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (law on the protection of patients and affordable care), which requires citizens to sign health insurance by 2014, otherwise they will have to pay a fine and have declared that it is constitutional under the government's power of taxation.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while the judges Scilia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2 700 pages and, furthermore, considered that the provision of the health system reform law, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered, otherwise it would be hard to lose all the federal funding of the programme, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the first of 2012, including the nominee designate Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the law.
Vote to the former combatants in Menon
At the heart of the terrorist cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, made a tribute, this Friday afternoon, to the soldiers and deceit of all wars.
Gerbes have been tabled in two of the three military crammes of the cemetery by the deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guial and various personalities.
Crossing between Palestinians and Israelis on the border in Gaza
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday 31 October 2013 at the night in a violent crow on the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power station in the Gaza Strip stopped working on Friday 1 November after the exhaustion of its fuel stocks, announced the Energy Authority of the Palestinian enclave.
A local commander of the Bogades Ezzédieine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another framework of the armed wing of Hamas, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a shells shells fired at an Israeli army incursion to the east of Khan Younès, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials in Brigades al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were leading a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel widened by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli hair and a blunt bulldozer made a 100-metre incursion into the territory before then withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier", threatened the spokesman.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a broad tunnel that has been widened in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, to "terrorist activities."
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, specifying that the aim was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive enslavement targeting the forces of Tsahal (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israel in the north of Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians", and also indicated the spokesman of the Peter Lerner Army.
On the other hand, Israel has struck an air military base in north-west Syria, aimed at a shipment of missiles targeted at Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday 31 October the satellite channel Al-Arabiya.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah", but it's just adding.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Setting "exclusive sources" that she didn't name, the Saudi capital channel indicated that "the bombing was targeted at a cargo of ground missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at the dawn in an air defense base in Sonar Jabé, near Lahé, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of militants and medical sources was unable to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Dane Danse his two new group chorus: the first inspired by Henri Michelle's poems and poems, the second insuffé by the famous sooano oils of Spacano.
An evening that makes it possible to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to ticks and black ink in white.
A white screen serves as a wall of substance.
On the carpet, however white, in the vast space that is the theatre, the theatre, the profile, the profile, the end like a line and clothes of black, a body.
On the screen, Henri Michelles's ink is projected.
The body, simple relative, takes its form.
And this form will be the one of the whole coin: an enactment of physical imitation of designs.
The dansors, full of black people, only their hands and the face face, wait on each side of the game, rush when the next appearance appears, embodies it, come out.
This black and white game of Henri Michelles is being relaxed by soils, in a group in unison (a mass that solves), in large group of 12 soils where everyone carries out their sign.
We're thinking of "Glory of the morning," where, in solo, Chouinard carried out a series of written chorus tasks on cartels, put on the front line.
It's the same principle, the giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, pervert and electric guides.
Energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be shattering when Carol Prior takes refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, microphone, without sobriety or restraint, a share of the poem of Michelles, monocorde and monotone in the shouting, and will continue by dancing.
And the music restarts, and the sequence to resume.
This noise and energetic discharge, long, if it can, ends up drying and bursting.
Also, the regularity of the visual pace.
There are a few nice flashpoints - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like these hair hair, or these black tissues that extend the lines.
But the chorus approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the chorus, instead of going to meet the work of Michelles, has imposed itself, with its fleets.
The result: the bodies seem to be at a hat in front of the drawings.
Michelat's henchmen, like forms of Gestalt, open a wider and gigantic imagination than dancing, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its drunken dangers by a bullshopic light and the white signs in a sudden black theatre, is touching on the magic.
The public loved, the reception was warm.
The Gymnagedia, after the interact, is richer.
The scene is, in part, flags of grey, dancing and a piano are covered by tissue, like furniture in a left house.
At the piano, danglers were relaxing to play the game.
Their dismayed in music, touching, give real fragility.
On the scene, they spend couples, in duol, very sensory, even erotic.
Trafficking in group, small soils of transitions, which are moving around, shocking, writing is less binary.
There seem to be balls, so familiar with Chouinard, wearing the red nose, in very polarized, male-female parades.
The movies are carnasers, fugitives or players.
The gestation, the rides and the small screws are breaching the archaic, the grace and the ridiculous of the bodies in cooking, the people who are based.
But the coin takes his real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on the scene when the public leaves.
Here, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the world's exploded universe is superseded, the drunken dangers, descending among spectators, glossy, smoking, short-circuit, playing applause codes, shattering the salmon in a highly calculated disorder that remains senseless.
Jojoy and folly transpired, and it's the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings concerning the Nortel patents
The group with thousands of former patent patents started an avalanche of legal proceedings on patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, especially Google, the company that it hastened to the pole at the auction auction that took place after the collapse of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for 4.5 Md, lodged complaints against Samsung Electrics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violation before the US Court of Assurance in Texas.
Rockstar is held jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of having violated seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising in connection with Internet research terms, have indicated the findings of the trial, which is the heart of Google's occupation.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture telephones that work under the Android operating system of Google, which pits fierce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of 900 M dollars for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its supply several times, in the end to offer $4.4.
After losing the Nortel patents against Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Moody's Mobiliary for an amount of $12.5, a market in part based on Motora's patent library.
Although it failed in its attempt to acquire patents at the auction, Google violated and continues to violate such patents, indicated the conclusions of the trial.
Rockstar calls for greater damage and interests against Google, because it claims that Google's patent violation is obstinate, according to the plaintiff.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water driver at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas flight.
The explosion of an inhabitation in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a grandmother 52 years old and his grandson 5 years old, is due to a flight of gas from a faulty heater, last Friday night the replacement of the prosecutor of the King.
The expert posted on the spot by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a flight and a gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of both victims is still committed.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is seriously burnt.
The little boy, who was in his grandfather and his companion, was on his side and was burnt more slightly.
"The two victims were intuitive and long conditioned on the ground before being taken to the CHU of Liège, it helicopter, it ambulance," specified the quagmire José Paulet, descending on the scene.
Tragically, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
Sain and except, he was able to join the floor by the estateau stayed intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighbouring house, undermined by the explosion, have been relayed by the president of the CPAS.
The fire fighters in Andalusia and Namur and the Arches police have intervened.

Mohamed Morsi lent the inauguration oath, but it's unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a new Egypt when he lent the inauguration serath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his investiture before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth Head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He sworn in front of the 18 judges in the Court's black boy whose building on the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
We aspire to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic, said President Morsi during the formal ceremony broadcast directly on public television.
Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life for absolute freedom, true democracy and stability, explained Mr Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal organisation and hard pressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr Morsi arrived shortly after 11 hours, a local hour, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred fans had gathered before the Court to acclaim the new president and, starting from the presidential good presidential year, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage from his convoy to the very crowded streets connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Viewed as the little charismatic help of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased considerably since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to portray himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to end the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state. It declared Mohamed Morsi, in blue suits and Red Crescent, addressing the judges present in the orthodox room of booking where he sworn.
Later, Mr Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he gave his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was warning you.
Marshal Hussein Tantayes attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was greeted by the song of the people and the army, hand in hand... I was entangled by thousands of people gathered in the great theatre of university.
Fonted in 1908 and a former stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a fiefdom of Islamist student groups in the 1970 "s.
Mr Morsi made a symbolic sworn on Friday in Tahrir Square. Hence the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year, and called for the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former evouted president, had deowned.
But, by agreeing to lend formally to the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he warns against the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square accompanied dramatic populist gestures.
The Shutdown in the United States has slowed down the increase in the car market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, show the figures published on Friday by manufacturers, five of the six main players performed below expectations.
The three big manufacturers in Detroit have two-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts anticipated average 15.4 million sales at an annualized rate and corrected seasonal variations, but the market was set at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, analyst Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's clients, he believes that this slight brake is explained first by "the government shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first half of the month."
GM, however, reported an increase of almost 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, compared to 211 563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its peak-upp, has seen its sales move from 14% over one year to 191 985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194 301.
For his part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also display lower sales than consensus, despite increases over a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM action earned 1.4% at 16.35 GMT while Ford gave up 1.1%.
Renault plummeted on the Stock Exchange by the Nissan warning
Renault accuses Friday of the biggest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Moitor announced that he had cut by nearly 20% his forecast for annual net benefit, returns traders.
Nissan, who had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of his direction.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by "Warning."
"It's clearly the winning profit of Nissan," says a traitor of a Parisian broker.
Within the framework of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to the data of the Nissan website.
Greece: two deaths in a shooting near a local neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on board a motorway who went to a local party of the neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn in the west suburbs of Athens. Have we learned from police sources?
The police were not able at the moment to give information about the identity of victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards from their local.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, depending on the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service have been dispatched on the central avenue of the suburbs of the suburbs, No Iraqi, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident takes place a few weeks after the indictment of six members of Golden Golden, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
The call from Scott Brown
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be suspended for the next two matches of the Champions League championships, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Exploited against Barça for having sent a blow to Neymar, the Scottish middle saw his extended suspension at three meetings by UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club said "very disappointed," believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Almost 50 000 households are deprived of electricity on the whole province, shortly after midday on Friday, because of the violent winds affecting many regions along the Saint-Laurent river.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers plunged into the black, Montestre with 13 464 and the Outawanese with 8642.
The big region of Montreal also knows its lot of banners with almost 7,000 private households of rough power in the metropolis and Laval.
You thought that travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight centre seems to reverse the trend.
Society has revised its net profit forecasts and hopes for record results thanks to the vacancies of Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit on the whole exercise between 325 and 340 M before taxes, against a previous forecast of 305 to 315 M.
If current forecasts are reached, it will represent 12 to 17% of growth compared with the record profit of 290.4 M in 2011 / 12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8% of profits in the first half of the year and that the second half had started in force, especially with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on the right track to achieve record results on the whole exercise before deducting interest and taxes, he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the recreational travel sector has rekindled during the second half, which has helped to offset a domestic market for small business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Travel Trading Scheme has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
His subsidiary in the United States recovered his losses in the first half of the year where seasonal demand is lower and should benefit from the whole exercise for the third consecutive time.
The Flight Centre's actions increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people shoot on a hotel near the Cairo pyramid
Inknown inmates opened the fire on a hotel close to the Cairo pyramid in Egypt, without causing victims, as a result of an apparent dispute with workers made redundant.
The sponsors took the flight, specified the spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior, the police officer Abdel Lative.
This attack comes at a time when Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army dismissed the Islamist president Mohamed Morsi early in July and represses the protests of his followers in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature, pupils will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work of 1914.
The review will also present new texts to encourage a more diversified reading.
A course combining literature and English language will be removed.
Starting from 2015, pupils will have to pass an independent KCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and Maths programmes tomorrow, the first subjects to undergo a radical review.
It will make changes in other fundamental matters next year.
Moreover, Ofqual, the regulator's regulator, will reveal a reshuffle of the structure of the CSR, with a new credit rating system and lower prices.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a broad consensus on the need to reform our system of exams to restore public confidence, insisting that the CSR would be more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during school year) than most other countries.
By comparison, Australian schools offer on average 143 hours per year, and the Singapore pupils make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to spend more hours of time on meathes, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deepened mammals, as well as the greater importance given to materials in international rankings, would probably encourage schools to ensure more hours.
The programme will place more emphasis on the problems of the real world, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a piece of legislation adopted in July in this state and largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
A octogenarian hosts children with a gun to the Muy for Hallween.
The minors aged 9 and 13 were wearing the door to call for sweets on the evening of Hallween.
One of the vicinity of the Mud's headquarters visited by children opened the door by holding his hunting gun.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the police that he had been afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was in fact buried in a common mass of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial of German resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive at the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common mass of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he assured a daily newspaper on a daily basis based on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great post-war enigma.
The German secret services, the BND, ensured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were completely mistaken.
"August 1945, the body of Müller was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Reich by a commando," according to Mr Tuchel.
It was "a uniform uniformity."
"In the left-wing domestic pocket, among other things, it was his state of service with a photo." He continues.
Bild also published a document of the district of the district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery in the neighborhood.
The president of the Central Council of German Jews, Dieter Graumann, has declared himself shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it's a enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly trampled underfoot," he has insurmounted in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is among the important figures in the Third Reich who have never been caught.
He participated in the Wanne conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had, in particular, under his orders Adof Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962.
Pamela Anderson cut his emblematic brows and adopts a dramatic cut-off.
Pamela's banners have become famous thanks to his role in the TV series Sexy Alerte in Malibu.
Pamela Anderson is the last celebrity to shock his fans with a new dramatic hairdresser.
Alerte's old cradle of Alerte to Miliu has left his long hair hair out against a platinous banner.
The 46-year-old actress unveiled his new look when she walked into L.A. Wednesday and shared a photo on her page Twitter.
It's the first time in 20 years that the beautiful blonde has been cut off, and we are fan of discreet change.
What do you think of the Pammy hairdresser?
Tell us what you think about it in the comments below.
He works in the mud, the jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical assistance.
Dr Georges Bwit disregards free healthcare in Cameroon villages.
Dr Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends on seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 for 5 000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile machinery
Dr Georges Bwit is one of 10 Huros CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect him to Héos CNN of the year.
This person will receive $250 000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwshe watched his sick father alternating periods of conscience and conscience and traveled to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
James Bwit was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At the beginning, he had only a broken arm, but he contracted a infection that spread to his brain, creating a haematoma whose sequel he was going to carry the rest of his life.
There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, he said Georges Bwit.
We would have taken it abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr Bwit spent years to accompany his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he would get any treatment that he could benefit from.
It's not easy, adding Mr Bwit.
You can leave the house at 5 p.m., you rush to hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr Bwit's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctors for 5 000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organisation.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctors for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroon would not be able to pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health spending is carried out in the private sector.
The only problem they have is poverty, explained Dr Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
Having seen his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr Bwit was determined to try to change course.
Dr. Georges Bwit and his team of volunteers carried out more than 700 surgical acts free of charge during last year.
He became doctor himself, working like surgeon to the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit-making humanitarian association, ASCOVIE, which travels to rural areas during weekends to dispense free healthcare.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32 000 people.
Almost all Fridays, with 30 people, they get into a fodder after having set the medical material on the roof and crossing difficult land to go to the villages that most need help.
The chance does not always follow them.
They have often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or botched paths.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroes: the community organises a festival, chant, and dancing and offers them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr Bwelle is playing with his great smile and his overflowing energy is more than happy to join the celebrations.
The next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.
We receive 500 people on every visit, said Mr Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come up.
In this travelling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can receive balls, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate that is necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
The evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anaesthetic.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, a mayor or a house; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the playground to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrogen group, the operating room and the sterilisation of equipment, Dr Bwit and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's a tempting pace, but the village musicians generally help the team to remain motivated.
They hit on bulls all night to keep us awake so that we can continue to work, explained Mr Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of doctors from Cameroon and students in medicine, carried out 700 surgical acts free of charge during last year, and he knows that their presence can make the difference to those who come to help.
A man explained that the free operation he had suffered to treat a herd would allow him to work again.
This will change my future and that of my family, said man.
In addition to getting this travelling hospital alive and working like surgeon in hospital, Dr Bwit is also working night in private medical firms around Yaoundé.
It's this second job, he explains, who finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
I don't know when he drowns. He declared Kacy O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of the Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer within the group of Dr Bwelle.
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association so that they can carry out these campaigns.
For students in medicine and nurses like Kacy OMley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr Bwit in his missions, it's an opportunity for learning on the ground that they don't have at home.
We have been able to participate in operations to help to give blood or to pass the instruments on to Dr Bwelle, explained Miss O'Malley.
It's not something that you have the opportunity to do in America when you are studying in medicine in the second year.
Voluntary students pay in general for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with the medical equipment collected.
But once at Yaoundé, their pensions, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr Bwelle.
It's a hero, there is no doubt about it, he declared Kacy O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is not close to extinguishing.
For Dr Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that gives him immense joy.
I am so happy when I do this work, added Mr Bwit.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

The Two France Pierre Nora
Philosophy, academics have long been painted to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphibials and courses of courses?
Without doubt, but by underlining its weak for the roads, Sciences-Po, Upper Etudes.
Arbitrary works of others in his street office Gason-Gallies?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the publisher.
Heller of the faux that was occupied Fontenit to the French Academy?
Of course, but in the knowledge that such a sacred body cannot replace real holy oil, that of the theory, which has happened.
They've willingly recognized in him a great, inspiring, and unifying of their work, but by observing that he was reluctant to produce himself.
To this uncertain image, the monument of the "Livers of Remembrance", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The bad languages were able to see it as a huge market for chips, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a lively eye and lean of scholarship, but incurably divisive.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the person who passed for not writing had a lot and well written.
The book that this is supposed to bring to justice.
Once again, however, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagage, the jubilation that has been blown out of touch with one subject on the other.
But it's easy to understand that disparate objects gathered in this book in so beautiful a title bring the brandier to one and the same passion: that of finding out the novelty of French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: it's a concern of time.
Very little, we were collectively invited to give it a definition.
But in the pervasive spirit of our leaders then, French identity was an intimate essence.
We needed only to deploy accidents, and the case, Jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorised interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is all about is quite different.
He does not ask himself the heir of eternal frankness, he refuses to define it.
Analyst worried about a family stranded, he restates in a forest of symbols, arrested every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Does it come from the company itself: why, in a country that is so long-term in its borders, if formerly chartered and solidly maxed, are these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so pressing, suggesting Pierre Nora, than to conjure up the disorder born of the discord of French history.
Franks and Gaulaws, Armagnacs and Bourgignons, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that flies in two national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it. On the contrary, it wasn't the same thing as the sacred and all the more avid of unity and indivisibility that it cut the head to the one who was the obvious and powerful embodiment.
And, of that, an invincible nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this unique feature of French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside of the Hexaggerone, so the American espousal of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and the other made a revolution, writing a declaration of rights, wanted to build a new society.
But the American cousin only serves to underline what is our own.
There, men who left their Ancia Rérime in England and no longer care about it.
Here, crowded men of an indigenous, indigenous region, and all the more radical.
This is a consensual revolution when it sowed the drama and entrust it.
Here, the founding fathers always honoured, and here revolutionary ancestors whose models are hardly worth making, and who have stayed between themselves.
This is an institutional inconsistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, like mistakes to catch up and tests to be resumed.
France, which is going on, France.
But there was a time when the French thought they could recoup the roadside of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
In this IIth Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora has shown a lot of interest and even tenacity: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary divide, teaching schoolchildren everything that in the old France was conspicuous by modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peacemaking identity has only had a time.
Here again, we are in debate, driven by immigration of a new kind, threatened by the rise of restive minorities, absorbed in the European space.
So the book offers both the fascinating portrait of France and the cautious outline of France that comes.
With a premium, the portrait of historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It found that the railway was a camel.
The man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessively, around the same idea.
The crèche of manure was held at the center of the centre.
And the one who, more than half a century ago, tabled a subject about the idea of nation, but was removed from the original exercise of the theory, we entrust, cum grano salis, that he ended up doing it.
Of course, in a less rational, more fragmented and more subtle form.
But let us not deceive ourselves, just as binding.
Because much more than the figure imposed on university curricula, this theory says the internal need for a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Enlifted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team filmed a demonstration by Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retreaty since 2008, he took part in 2004 to set up the hostage-defense association "Outside the world," which he presided over for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the opportunity for the hostages to complain and to bring their hostages hostage before the International Criminal Court.
Dextending over 1 000 days, the four hostages in Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larrebe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féet were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Military Hospital of the Val-de-Wel Wednesday afternoon, they have been able to return to their families since then.
And try, little by little, to take over the course of their lives.
"The New Observer" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, ex-postponed, retired since 2008, the president of the "world" association.
From the evening of your release, you were on the 20th-century plateau of "Antenne 2."
What are your memories of your liberation today?
On the spot, in particular, in Beirut.
When I am released, I find myself in the coffers of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it is black - Roger Auque.
He tells me "we're liberated" but I'm not sure, and tell me that we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It's the war, and those who drive us are also very tense.
They are putting us on the edge of a trottle.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we come to the site of the Summmerland hotel where the press is present.
French are bringing us to the French embassy.
It's the time for the first wireless coups to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember having taken a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to the airport in Larnaca in Cyprus.
Arrived there in helicopter, you take a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boils.
How did you arrive on French soil?
We're terrified at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There is an incredible amazement.
And a lot of media.
When I was there there were three television channels.
I come back and there is full.
The descent of the airplane, the reunited with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Rise leads.
The motorists get the quagmire to make photos and follow me up to my home where I have to do a bit of the police to prevent some of them from rising.
Media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we are well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it's difficult to see it clearly.
We are getting out of a hole and we are suddenly in the media fires.
It's a bit complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
But we have done the hardest.
On the evening, I'm at 20.00, the next day too I am on TV.
Then there is a kind of readjustment to life, very slowly, for one or two months, which are a bit like holidays.
How did medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing?
I had the right to a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in the Val-de-For-the-following days my return: radios, reviews of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It's not a sitting that does everything but we know that you can count on him, if need be, that we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage-takers.
It's logical.
It didn't embarrass me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I listen to what is said.
The debate on ransom in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I try to do the things between questions about my past as hostages and my cascade of chairman of the "Outcome World" association that allows me to distance myself, and I think it's much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, along with others, for recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
In my opinion, there is a problem of semantics.
We need to call hostage hostage hostage hostage - which is usually the case - and allow hostages to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostages hostage before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in sympathy, in emotion, and welcomes the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is doing this.
Why do you not say to the hostage takers "you flouted the rules of the war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, you'll get to justice"?
This seems legitimate, legitimate, struck by common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shocked me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
The anger in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the defeated president Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the re-establishment of the country's first democratically elected president.
It's not a trial highlights this Muslim Brotherhood militant.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteers have been able to take a copy of the documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Mohamed Morsi's trial is a false trial. He is a pro-Morsi, it's he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres in Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
There were clashes in Alexandria, the police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20 000 police will be deployed before the police academy in Cairo, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel blames 9 US States for violating gay rights
Ever since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have a right to an identity card identity card of the Department of Defense and to the benefits that come with", recalled the minister in New York in a speech before Anti-Defamation League in the fight against anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to the same sex partners in the National Guard facilities" located on their territory, he denounced, reproaching these states for violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social services or health services provided in these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defense said that he ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Greass, to ensure the implementation of federal law.
The frontloading of nine states began with Texas, which refuses to implement these benefits on the settlements of the Texane National Guard, owing to a conflict between the textual law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Caroline of the South and West Virginia, according to a senior defense officer.

A case of rabies detected at a cat in the Val-de Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected at a chaton in the Val-de Oise, obviously of foreign origin while France was unscathed by indigenous cases since 2001.
The chaton was found on 25 October in Argmenthe and he died on 28 October.
The rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasker Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this chaton between 8 October and 28 October included," says the ministries of health and agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the chaton have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"Chance man, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier, but before the symptoms arise, is very effective," says the communiqué.
The ministries now call on people who would have been dead, grieved, relayed, or lashed on a muquet or skin damaged by this chaton or whose animal would have been in contact with this chaton between 8 and 28 October to contact the 0811.00.00.95 a.m. between 10 a.m. and 18 hours from 1 November.
"France has been scared of rabies since 2001, this chaton or the mother have been imported from another country, unscathed," according to the communiqué.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last "indigenous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially unscathed from this disease in November 2001 by the International Office for Animal Health (OIE)."
A case of rabies on an illegally imported chip from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"rabies is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time", recalls ministries and transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease arise.
Obama's reform of the health system
Under an avalanche of critics, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.
After hundreds of thousands of people received opinions from their providers "resilience, Republicans criticized the president over the past few days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
The vast majority of people who have health insurance that suits them can keep it, he said in a speech in Boston.
Talking about what he calls "a dramatic rise in the current state of affairs on the residences, President Obama has encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive health care and better adapted for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
You will win a winner, he said.
The Administration announced that we should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who contracted their insurance themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
Let me address myself directly to those Americans: you deserve better, said Kathleen Sebelius during his testimony to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Mrs Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch in October of the online market had failed miserably.
I'm also frustrated and irritated than anyone else, she added.
I look forward to recovering your confidence.
It's a Kathleen Sebelius exasperus who gave this sentence, when she thought she was a microphone, by addressing an assistant sitting behind she at yesterday's sitting following an exchange of contentious views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, to know if she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billary Long has repeatedly asked Mrs Sebelius why the architect of the Afforddable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce the government's sponsored insurance to sign a regime via HealthC.Gov, which she now vines to millions of Americans.
Beetry a special camel at Abu Dhabi
The happy elected, Jke Victe Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while incorporating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the runway.
German Sebastian Vettel, quadruple champion of Formula 1 world, eased for free trials of Abu Dhabi's Grand Prix Friday a special camel whose design was carried out by a Mexican fan 21 years old.
Vettel chose one of 1,500 desks sent from all over the world, in a competition launched by one of sponsors, a car brand, its stony.
He was invited to follow the GP of Abu Dhabi, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion, on the pist and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this Friday and Saturday, to test trials.
It's likely that he will have another special camel Sunday, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive global title.
An inhabitant of Aubervilliers launches his suburbs Party
Let us not deceive ourselves above all.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermine, its founder, the "suburbs Party" is not just directed at the banners.
I chose a French card as logo, justifying it.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented on Thursday at the press conference in his home municipality of Aubervililliers, was born of the will to defend multiculturalism better, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighborhoods above all.
My proposal No 1 is to create a Ministry of multiculturalism, it says.
Abdel-Malik Djermine, 50 years, a territorial attachment, claims today as "100% apolitical" even if it has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevènement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin from 2010 to 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left but if right-wing people are prepared to support me, I will listen to them too, continue.
There are only extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermine has built his programme - consultable on Internet- from many topics that are supposed to speak to the people of suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalisation of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years, the rehabilitation of the function of guardian of the building...
It remains to be found candidates to train lists and defend its ideas on the political scene. "For the municipal elections in 2014, it risks being fair, recognises".
It's a problem of time and money.
The suburbs Party should still be represented in Aubervitilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermine already has seven heads of list in France metropolitan and Martinique.
"And the messages of support that I received since yesterday do not come from all of the suburbs" are happy.
John Kerry admitted, unparalleled, that American espionage had gone too far inappropriately.
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programmes by admitting, without precedent, that on several occasions, spying has gone too far in an inappropriate manner.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he had, like Barack Obama, governed on automatic pilot, when a series of inflammatory revelations of whistleblowers Edward Snowden about the NSA spying activities came into being.
The leaks put the US government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: "It's undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have been aware of certain things in an automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War and until the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course 11 September.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that American espionage had gone beyond the confines, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said: in some cases, it went too far in the wrong way.
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he now has an in-depth review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr Kerry insisted, however, on the fact that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to blow them up and attack governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have effectively prevented planes from falling, building blocks and people being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will go to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the United States, explained on Thursday the president of the Senate sub-committee on European affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut indicated that he had spoken to Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was worried about the threats they made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organisations because of the feeling of frustration that the surveillance of the National Security Agency raises.
It really is important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay on our side in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism, declared Murphy, a democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the subcommittee of the European Senate of the United States Senate, during an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make them understand that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which damaged relations with some allies of the United States, but the director of the agency said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metaphors that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations have reported documents published by Snowden according to which the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and from 34 other Heads of State.
The director of the intelligence services, James Clair, justified the espionage of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy indicated that his office was organising a congress of Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be unveiled in the coming days.
He indicated that the route was still to be defined.
Murphy said that the purpose of this journey was to improve relations, but also to show a clear firmness.
He explained that European Heads of State should be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they themselves apply for years.
We can change our surveillance programmes in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not alone in the world to make espionage, said Murphy.
Meanwhile, Kerry planned to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the ransom created by US strategies in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange ended on Thursday, overshadowed by Shell's bad performance and after a announcement by the Fed of maintaining its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian is calling for his prison sentence in Thailand
A constituent of Sydney of 21 years, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for allegedly having been attacked by a taxi driver, has appealed for judgment and has been released bail.
Steath Rochle Bamford was first found guilty by a Court of Province of Phuket on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled him, attacked him early on Sunday 10 June.
However, video recordings later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after she separated her small Australian friend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted that she had invented the history of all coins.
She was detained in a local local authority before hearing before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a prison sentence of 15 days in a detention center of low security on the periphery of Phuket rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League of Drugby Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Foreign Ministry of Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks said at the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney that the entire family was extremely concerned about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her to go back to Australia.
We have, of course, experienced an anguish moment, but we hope to bring it back to the home safely as soon as possible, said Tunks.
Bamford appealed to the judgment and was released after the payment of a 50 000 bait deposit.
In Australia, the press said that, in the meantime, it was on holiday in the region of Krabi, southern Thailand.
Thai legal sources have indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence that could go up to two years imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, a Australian travel agitation, Thailand could also seek to refine its damaged image with tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will stop the supporters of Anderlecht coming other than with the RSCA cartels
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germant, Tuesday, communicated Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson for the police area Brussels-12, Friday.
The Belgian CSR supporters who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will necessarily have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police since a former border post of Rekem up to the PSG stage," sent the spokesman.
The process will be the same for return.
"If other supporters had an intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has made it known that measures have been taken to make arrests or even custody," he has announced Marie Verbeeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeys school committee
At the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeys, 62% of pupils have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, pupils, teachers and members of education staff, to reflect on ways to better integrate pupils who live with the horse between several cultures.
The school commission has just unveiled its vision of "live together in French."
The Vision Vision Forum has been promising for a year in schools to help pupils from all origins to find common benchmarks that are not confined to the French language.
The discovery of districts, our architecture, our places are benchmarks.
Big names of writers, artists, whether they are of a strain or they have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So, we're creating projects so that they identify with all this," explains the president of Vision Diversity, Aïda Kamar.
Michel Vée, the Institute of New World, identified several challenges for the school committee.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is culture quebec, the sense of belonging, support for staff in the transformations that we live in, in the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeys school commission created a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, quebec.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that's what the real need is," sum up.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
