Story about coffee in administration (not at mine, fortunately): a department organised sometimes a breakfast for the service, with pastries, tea, instant coffee, basically a little something.
One day management told them that from now on, this kind of expenditures would have to go through a process of public markets.
So now, when they have their breakfast, it's a private company who sends a guy to drive 60 km with the food and the coffee.

> The blockchain can do without this trust tier, in the vast majority of cases it's not useful so use a blockchain rather than a good old DB is a simple mess.
Except that it requires that your blockchain be sufficiently distributed to have thirds of trusts and to prevent that minors modify it.
First option: A public blockchain but I doubt that even Ethereum supports all the flow of carrouf chickens.

-03-13 The game is constantly evolving, I personally like it a lot so I'm going to promote it a little bit.
> Ugly They've really improved that aspect lately, and they're about to change all the character models (so all the animations, armours and so on, they don't have a choice, at the same time).
> Uninteresting story You're the only judge of that, I've haven't looked into it, however I had great feedbacks.
> The element that first tempted me was the huge tree of "talents" where you can build the skillset that you want.
Except that when I made some research on the forums, I realized that if you want to reach the late game, you need the best build from the start, and that the respecialization is so annoying that it's advised to create a new character.
Since the leveling is annoying, thanks but no thanks.
First, I don't know when you tried the game out, but the leveling has improved a lot (we went from doing the same four acts at different difficulties three times to ten acts only once, per character, that being said).
Then, it's true that if you want to be far enough, it can't be a shot in the dark.
But there are a lot of builds able to complete the entire content (actually, with investment, almost everything).
Internet guides are not always correct, or easy to reach for a beginner, but there are pretty easy things that are nice to play.
On the other hand, you always have to be ready to learn a lot to play freely, it's very dense, and not really accessible.
By the way, on your last point, even if Poe now has a tutorial, you have to admit that it's awful to begin with.
And about the flasks, you have to consider them as stand-alone spells, and unless I didn't understand you, there isn't really any alchemist, and the type using the most flasks is very pleasant.
(and the video you shared looks annoying to play, I agree).
Of course, to each their own, but I had to give a little credit to this game!
  I was talking on a technical point of view (the scientific approach, the way the experiments are done) because yes, as such, there is no link, agreed.
But out of curiosity, I would like you to explain the different experiments as well (if it's not too long).

I don't know if it's leading but I like Gotaga, Skyroz, Millenium, Oserv   Especially about Fortnite but they play other games too Edit; they are channels, you tools who down voted.
A brigade is cracking down on travestistes in our streets > Hiring a transvestite (qualified or not) does not constitute a problem if that person has values compatible with the work that is asked of him or her.
If only the Human Resources Managers were not subject to the needs of companies, right!
Societal debate is a risk for the company, and it's generally by default ('why take the risk' is by default), just as clearly gay people are generally seen as problematic, so why take any risk when you can just say that they don't correspond to the company's needs?
A modern company asks for standard people who will cause as little trouble as possible, hiring 'standard' employees eases the process of integration into the company (it doesn't exclude minorities as long as they remain discreet) so why add a potential problem?
Discrimination is really annoying and dangerous for private companies, so they're better off avoiding the problem during the hiring process.
Edit: "And for the "[...] there's no hope finding a job..." Don't worry, they still can work for Uber/Deliveroo, this kind of job does not care about its employees' backgrounds.
It gives a chance to the former prison inmate who decided to stop breaking the rules of society and it also leaves the door open for the most reckless ones, whatever their political or societal orientation might be.
The final conclusion is that I can't judge but there are all sorts of things everywhere and it's better that way (some will disagree, ok).
Well the slavic defense is an opening of failure, you know... 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 And in my message what I shared is only the facts, the google research for "NRA membership" have increased by 4900% after the gun control episode.

Nothing quite funny but nothing horribly dramatic ; more than 80 years old and dying suddenly at home while he could still sit up nicely and be completely lucid, after a respectable and fulfilled life, this is not far from ideal I think.
Of course, it is very tough for his family, and as I could not go to the funeral, I am then writing a letter of condolence.
It is possible to measure this discrepancy (for example : 13 seconds per month) and to configure the computer to adjust again the clock regularly with the opposite discrepancy.
Of course it is an awful geek thing to do, and obviously, it is planned under Linux and not under Windows.
The program `hwclock` and the configuration file /etc/adjtime` are used for that.
And of course with the omnipresent networks and NTP, all this is not quite used anymore.

As for the accusations of communism, if I had seen a political system that I fancied, I would have mentioned it directly, I wouldn’t have wasted my time writing a stupid massive column.

The song of the Empress is rather bland actually (and way worse than what they did before) and very repetitive, but that’s what works isn’t it?
How to prevent people from posting pictures of my kid on Facebook?
It’s your kid, he’s a minor, you do whatever you want.
You are the legal guardian, you have the right to tell them to go away.
If you already told them in a nice and polite way but those idiots don’t seem to understand then you turn it up a notch.
You just tell them still in a nice way but firmly that, no, you don’t want them to take picture, or you get them out of your house.
Only once will suffice to get your message across.
The problem with families with rednecks (so basically every family) is that you CAN’T get a message across nicely.
They are in their own trip and if you say something you will look like a bore and you will be ignored.
Like “Oh for fuck’ sake Michel is annoying with his stupid ass rules, it’s fine we just chugged 4 bottles of wine, we’ve done worse , alright I’m leaving before Jackie gets nut and takes my keys” without understanding why their conduct is neither accepted nor acceptable.
You will be the bore in any case, so it’s better if it’s clear and fast  before their habits are too anchored, or before your daughter has an instagram and twitter account to her name without you knowing it.
And if they post it on social media without telling you , you flag it and ask it to be removed.
 They killed the few remaining coherence that was left :D

So it is about achieving an anti-flatulence lifestyle.
Despite all this I managed to get around it thanks to the power of the brain.
The human body is simple and likes cycles, so try not to fart at work and relax during more convenient times (after waking up, in the evenings, week ends ...).
You'll see your body will soon understand and your flatulence issues will disappear gradually without you even noticing.
I know it's hard when someone with whom you were really connected to leaves because of other things going on :/ Let's just say it's better now than after a year, or even longer :( Internet hug, enjoy life !

No, that's the **present** participle form, and it's in no way correct in this text's sentences.
It would be fine this way: "the person *residing* at this address.
Otherwise, rarely as an adjective like the resident doctor.
But if there is no name agglomerated with it, an adjective cannot as well be a subject by saying "the resident", but that's being stupid and pleonasmic.

It doesn't leave a lot of time to learn about nutrition, study the glycemic indexes of different kinds of food, the way a certain nutrient affects a product, etc., rather than just go through the supermarket looking for what's on special.
1- The US administration has to grow a pair of balls and sanction owners of large stores if they try to move the cost of the regulations to the final consumer (unlikely), 
I you're talking about price increases and items that are nutritionally unfavorable, I'm also seeing that as something to develop more.
A food tax could even be used to tax bad products and make the price go down on healthy foods (to be debated).
2(b)- If you follow your train of thought, you can almost say that all regulation on unhealthy products is useless because everybody knows it gives you cancer.
3- You can also imagine that in the long term, a better-fed population will be happier, more productive, healthier, and that will alleviate a financial burden from society.

So bikes, silent, have something to make themselves heard by pedestrians.

Your comment is lit.
Already answered, you need to read comments and watch videos until the end.
>I'll admit, a guy screaming "dirty fascist" might actually be a Mussolini admirer.
Continue to show publicly that you don't know what antifa means.
>It's not a mirror, it's mostly incoherence on your side.
Ok, you don't know what incoherence means any more than antifa.
>They're not the ones kicking them out, they ask their SO friends or cops to kick them out.
Antifas use physical violence threats, that's different.
And nothing allows you to state with certainty that they are antifas.
I feel like you're one of these people that think that wiping your ass makes you a proctologist.
Sorry to tell you, it doesn't work that way.
>You should really watch the video.
You're good at repetition comedy, we'll give you that;
If it's done you now need to meditate on documents that you have looked at because you obviously haven't understood anything.
Kicking out fascist scum from a demo doesn't make you an antifa.
It takes time to digest a name.
By the way what's funny is that the new names are sometimes tested on pets.
( sorry for those who are defending animals )  Think of Max or Isis.
This video, and this channel in general deserve your time.
What a friendly answer in honour of the poet  Who announces Heredia, Rimbaud and Mallarmé.
Like an albatros - what am I saying ? A bearded vulture,  He scrutinises the corners of our humanity !
The post that gets upvotes only because it doesn't hit too hard on the majority of the sub (EM and centre-left), even thought it's low effort, full of spelling mistakes, and ugly.
Well no, the NF and the UPR are parties, so you need a card etc to be a real member.
There there are literally no limits.
The NPA on the other hand I'll admit I don't know anything about them, but I doubt a lot of people want to cause them harm.
I'll be in France for a month.
What towns should I visit ?
Versailles (at least the palace).
At least one castle in the Loire (Chambord?).
Brittany is clearly forgotten from your list even though it's great.
Don't go to Nancy, honestly it's so sad you could die.
The fact that it is based on gold makes it independent of the monetary system based on "debt-money" (the QE, the bill slate of central banks) and particularly of the dollar, of which the value depends on the oil market (not enough US gold to guarantee the value of money).
Same conspiracy as with the CFA franc...  >2- The fact that a 2011 report precisely, coming from the IMF (under the presidency of DSK), which confirms more or less the viability of this alternative money, represents a risk for the US dollar, based mostly on oil transactions (they don't have enough gold to sufficiently cover the cash in circulation).
Big risk for the dollar /s .... oh erm ,  if you are really serious, you answer yourself " Dollar"    >We know now that Syria came just after, and that it was going to be a big chunk.
Hallelujah    > In any case, if there's one thing I'm certain of, it's that Sarkozy's war in Libya wasn't in the interest of the French or of France, but indeed in his and his "clan"'s.
You will make that remark to the families of 56 French people dead in the Libyan State's attack, to the Bulgarian doctors and nurses too .... :) I'm sure that putting an end to a regime where Europeans are tortured and raped, isn't in our interest /S
... sorry it's the morning.
We can start by the title of this video that is more delirious than it is real journalist work.
It was just beneath your comment.
>You're often wrong and history proves you wrong.
I'll give you that that's reason enough to be bitter.
>When would you have been right ?
It's very useful to import data !
I use a dll named OpenXml for that.
It's a life changer !
It's not Mother's day 🤦‍♀
To make the difference between the number of votes for Trump, and the percentage of voters.
Not only prison for murder attempt but also pension for damages.
Also, these people are rejected by society or widely underprivileged, why are you expecting them to want to help others ?
Which of the egg or the hen ?
Society could be a bit wiser than the people that make it.
Yeah, between Saint Denis and Noisy.
What a mess it's going to be .
  Yes I thought about it but no !

Who are the homeless people living in the streets of Paris ?
Look we don't have their nationality, diploma or professional path.
GAFA taxation : a tax "between 2% and 6%" according to the Mayor 
> 2% on the CA, that's far from being negligible.
You also need to follow the discussion, we were saying that 2% of CA on the gafam is 10% of taxation, WHICH IS VERY LITTLE.
For the rest, the fleeing of investors ... what are you talking about ?
We're talking about taxing a business revenue, what do the neighbours on Google or Facebook's CA have to do with France ?
  You're welcome !
For that sake, I'll make myself some waffles this week.
Maybe tonight even, I need to see if I have everything !
Pesto waffles + chicken is also super nice to make a dish.
 They knew the mines weren't too safe, that's why at the start he takes the risk of going through the mountains (that nearly kill him) and the palantír is only used to spy on (to connect to) other palantír (at that time they didn't have one) We can carry on like that but the other arguments need to make sense.
 You made an app, you click on the student's surname and it send a text telling that the student is babbling.
Social network =/= reality but when you add news paper to that…
 Yes but that's the thing I don't see why you will continue to do some quests if it's not rewarding for you.
(Yes, skins are not rewards)
Loosing 40% of your revenue doesn't really matter when you're earning minimum wadges, above this it's absolutely catastrophic if you want to keep your way of life!
(and honestly you need to keep a war treasure when your salary is above 30k per year because unemployed situation is not really a security in that case)

I will give you a hint, they have a daughter for them in the little office.
Science never proved the fact that god doesn't exist; science just hasn't proved that God exists.
All the "of the seas" things are absolutely ugly but the Cunard's ships (specialy the Queen Mary 2) or the Ponant's ones for exemple are more elegant.
Let's not make any amalgam please.
in Martine saga... Haha some Martine memes always cheesy but always so funny.
This is what shocked me in Chris Rock's audience: In France there will be every kind of people in the public and here it's only black people and a little bit of white.
We can see that it's still a long way to go!
EDIT: Yes and the difference between black and white people, we are still in this debate, holy cow!
Baudrillard is a semiotician, Marxist too.
The two exist much more in the Anglo-Saxon world than in France.
These are some French theorists who survived thanks to Americans.
At random like this I follow: In drawing:  @jawcooper @elizabethjeanyounce @liliarnoldstudios (linogravure)  @daemonrich (minifigs paintings) @continuum_watercolors   In comics : @sarahandersencomics @nathanwpyle   In tattooing : @mirkosata @supakitch @mauddardeau   In science: @natgeo @natgeowild @cnrs @johnbishop67  Tell me if you want any others!
I also follow lots of food things (just nice pastries or recipes) and photos of cute animals  (like on reddit in fact).
You can also follow tags, that could help you discover interesting profiles.
Which sports camera for a 15 day trek?
the Yi 4k is the famous camera which has been giving GoPro a cold sweat for a few years.
It fits perfectly within your budget and the video quality is really good (compared to a Hero 5 black for €100 more).
On the other hand the sound isn't ideal and it needs a box to go underwater.
I don't know if it can resist rain without one.
You also have the hero 5 session which could be interesting depending on your use: very small, really easy to use.
In all cases you will find tons of cheap accessory packs on Amazon to equip it to go anywhere.
I'm expecting whataboutism on the other parties in response but I keep cool.
Citizen's vote for or against nuclear power by the France Insoumise: why?

No, no, look at his history, he really believes what he writes.
He's not a troll, just a catho who's been brainwashed to the extreme.
  At the Employment Center they didn't offer me anything except for reconversion training to IT!
This mailing list in particular isn't bad, besides it's through this that I found the postdoc contacts through which I got an interview.
Then they replied positively because some people from their lab know some people in mine well \\^^  And if this lead doesn't produce anything, I have someone who can offer me something else: a wider network!
And yes, there's luck, you need to be at the right place at the right time > the fisherman's job   Argh I have a female doctor friend in genetics to whom they offered to become a butcher... she's a vegetarian.
- 2018-03-08  That depends a lot on the relation you have with him.
If you get along well with him it's better to tell him honestly specifying that you only want to go through the interviews for now.
If he's an idiot you don't tell him anything.
If he's neither one or the other you do as you wish.
Napoleon III Visiting Flood Victims in Tarascon” painting by William Adolphe Bouguereau 1856.
Ah but it's not the southwestern part of Tarascon, that explains all because I did not understand how they could be flooded with an altitude between 463 m and 1,187 m (the southeastern part of Tarascon is from a minimum of 3m to a max of 200m).
Libre - 2018-03-20  Nonononono, you should keep your  Morteau sausage for madame Stardust.
  Finally wasn't it also a political story as well?
The type where the guy was opposed to the party in power.
Maybe it should be highlighted more ;) In any case, good job for the work!
My brain has  bugged out :p
  Did you ask him what and how especially?
  At the time you were there it was less expensive than now I think.
:/ Might the hivemind have an idea for a chill, fun bar near the 9th?
One that's open late enough (10 pm/11 pm)?
In the worst case, you can count the alphas/betas in it but in 99% of cases you have to go all in to make money.
 For me at the beginning you have to focus on one heart of each type (DPS/SUP/TANK) and after to choose a backup hero which he manage well in each class as well.
But if you haven't been playing for more than a week it's a little better to do all the plays in quickplay to learn how it works and how to oppose each hero.
  Too many seconds have passed before I dug...
  Start gently, like with a dick pic.
This doesn't look like it will happen because globally, the incomes of the Japanese are less equal than those of the Canadians.
Their GINI index is 37.9 compare to ours which is 31.6.
  What do you use as a French keyboard in Android ?
I try to use AnySoftKeyboard, but the French package is pretty bad
I'm looking for something with a fat dictionary (Dicollecte), and especially some keys to write in good French (French quotation marks, typographic apostrophe)...
  Aha I just got them it doesn't change anything!
You take more time to recover after an evening of drinking, but you still have lots of time to do lots of things.

You are a perfect example of  what I'm talking about.
New strategy for the members of r/the_dindon in order to counter the crypto-fascist cabal of reddit administrators.
Is it fake or real?
I filtered them before it was even possible on reddit so I don't know.
How do they manage to always have so many upvotes ?
 We should create a sub just to insult them without them knowing!
That would be so brave !
 And for the first one, only put raisin bread so that you can fuck with the greedy pigs.
Sten is with the magazine on the side.

What a load of potential !
For a low income guy like me I'm happy my plan to make money easily succeeded.
Anyway, can someone explain to me why there is a sudden wave of realisation now, when it's been obvious since the creation of Facebook that it was just a personal information sucking machine?
Are people this blind or what?
The one with the paralegal "Au revoir la haut", "Enfermés dehors"
This is why I specified "with an office software program".
I also sometimes code on my PC with Ubuntu during my commute :p. However, I code for myself.
I am not paid more to get up at 5am and come back at 8pm, during business travel.
After all I'm not going to work for my company in the train.
 To be honest I think I'm still quite far from the end, I'll see in a few days :) And sure enough there is a DLC, if I buy it after having started my game will I still be able to do it in this game ?
 Potentially interested as well > (Apart from the last bar) For a particular reason or just because it's too obvious ?
But... your extract sucks.
Why does it make you laugh ?

 Oooh but here are people who are are cool !
 We just did dark soul 3 with a friend, and I really liked it (it's the first dark soul that I've played).
It's quite adapted to playing with a controller with a friend since you die often, the controlled changes hand often ahah.
How would you rate Bloodborne compared to ds3 ?
I think my friend is subscribed to PS, also it would be a good continuation since we've basically finished ds3.
It is still funny to ear the FI having doubts about the media's independence (carry by the 9 billionaires) while journalist have no ideologic or politic link with their owner and claim that the media is totally independent from the FI.
They should not take us for dumb people.
Harry is a pain in the neck, but very powerful and Ron is a really good sidekick.
So you finish everything, but your beer?
 I don't know but in the end I am the one who will have to deal with the customer begging for his offer and because I'm a cool guy, I do whatever I can to help him.
I don't think that he will be bothered to receive his 3d only tomorrow :)
How to eat at the same time as French people and the same way?
First, you have to eat at lunch.
A real meal, not a sandwich on the go.
It's better to eat the main meal at lunch, not at dinner like we are used to do.
With a real meal in your stomach, you'll be less hungry or nor as early.
But nothing stops you from taking a snack at 4 or 5PM.
At worse you can even take a light collation at 6 when you go home like 1 or 2 cookies.
No more to not spoil your appetite, get too hungry and eat too much (bad things) at this time.
The food quality also has an impact on the feeling of being full.
Favouring fat and protein, compared to carbohydrates, allows you to be full for a longer time.
Protest headcount: counting or settling scores?
And at 8 minutes she claims that she gave the other one too.
  The problem is that when she annoys me I close up and I completely ignore her :/  And then she doesn't have any money, and for me, it's hard at the end of the month ..
Of course, it's political correctness which led the guy to shoot his school full of jews.
Nothing to do with him being neo-nazi, nasty SJW.
Don't forget to change your Android keyboard in english… 🍵
The wording, the question, in short everything made me think of you :p

  In general a salesman likes to sell ;)
In the end, they do all they can to destroy AND Melanchon, and The Media, to Hamon's profit
 Ah yes interesting, I think I'll probably try all that.
Where do you usually order your boxes?
In her boxes, I found " The wife's book," with a hand-written note shaped like a bookmark saying "Book to read entirely and before getting married if possible."
I knew the content would be epic, I didn't know how much.
It was funny at the beginning and then I read on a Catholic website that they still sell this book: "Pierre Dufoyer (pseudonym Père René Boisgelot, S.J., 1898-1959).
Shall we organise a fund?
Not so long ago they were looking for Osama lol
The moderator chose to base themselves on French laws which, in my opinion, are better to maintain a healthy debate and avoid to be at each other's throat.
Americans got to the point to make safe spaces where people only talk to people who agree with them, because of overliberal debate rules.
 Could I be the godfather?
Oh yes it's totally related
The power of the Havre's harbour!
And some of them are probably underage.
And I bet they're all made in Taiwan, uh ... just sayin'
 For privacy and security reasons I won't tell you "go ahead and if I'm available, I'll get the beer?"
but if I ever get to the point to send you a mail, or worse an EMAIL with kittens!
And hugs, we all need hugs.
Actually privatization began at the end of the 80's, after a time of fraudulent activities (it's the Yakuza's country, do not forget) and a decrease in passengers (because of the crisis).
The result was that the Government decided to start the privatization by creating semi-private businesses for each region (6).
But retaining even more control over it.
Actually it's at the beginning of the 2000's that some became entirely private (but not all of them!).
But in the end you still have the JR Groupe who has all 6 businesses.
So you still have a pretend rivalry, but *in fine* it's the same business.
And the Ministry for the Territory, infrastructure, transportation and tourism still has a say.
Japan is pretty special because you still have pretend rivalry and privatization the State is never very far away.
Voluntary or not because politicians are *very* friendly with large businesses.
> I always had a problem with people bringing their children to a protest.
And those who bring their children to mass?
I didn't want to “attack” anyone by saying that it's not a grown-up way to be.
I presume that it's a matter of taste.
However, I agree with the ironing subject.
Are there any golden rules to follow in the kitchen, temperatures, things not to do, with regard to cooking, spices not to mix together and how to bring out their flavor?
Bay leaves before the vegetables, but after the meat, when you still have oil in the skillet!
Is there a consensus in the French population about immigration?
The media are pro-immigration, yes.
I do make a difference between "I have the right" = I can ask for it and do it, it isn't prohibited (and the person in front of me also has the right to refuse to do it, as well), and "It's my right," implying my constitution right = I cannot be denied.
In general, an engaged pro-IVF feminist tends to imply the second case when she puts the word "right" in her sentence.
I can leave the benefit of the doubt, but I still get the impression that they're often hammering the word "right" when talking about IVF as if they wanted to convince us that it was really a constitutional right.
22-16 That feels good, shit.
 This is the problem with living in a society.
I don't watch France TV and I don't listen to public radio, but I still pay.
I don't want to have children, but I still pay for those of others.
I'm not in an association, but my taxes fund them anyway.
Okay, this will lower absenteeism, but seeing sick teacher dying in front of their students, is this what we want?
 Don't worry, he's masturbating.
And since this makes you go deaf, there's no chance of his hearing your little chubby fists soiling your ceiling.
Cooking Question: How to you properly reheat leftover poutine?
A little cottage cheese added to the poutine before reheating it in the oven (or toaster oven, which is quicker) helps with the final taste.
Plus a touch of butter.
That might be an idea.
Honestly, it's not the easiest thing to reheat without losing a lot of its quality, but in any case, in the toaster oven, it's much better than in the microwave (yuck).
/r/worldnews is not bad to know what's happening in the world.
Then it's private money, so I don't care (but not all that little, I have Altice shares, bought after their lousy results).
Edit: Shit ah, you're not answering the comment I thought.
The ratio that I quote is debt/ebitda, SNCF is 11, against 3.5 for Deutsche Bahn.
in truth I am a wiz in geography
 When can I resell it for parts (it's my first breakdown so I'd like to know a little more ahah)?
At the time, we didn't realize that means ... $30,000 / GB!
Slow news day = dogs run over.
The 1 in better: always the same five heroes, but each one has 3 specializations (mostly DPS close combat, DPS distance and tank), each specialization is characterized by an active skill (a dash, a zone stun, an accurate shot at a distance ...) and a passive ability (attack speed increased when you hit 3 enemies at the same time, constant regen of hp over time, damage reduction...).
In addition, you unlock skills (specific to each specialization) all five levels or so.
The maps are very beautiful, the addition of the chaos troops to the bestiary rejuvenates the game!
TLDR: We don't know anything, I read it for nothing :(
[MidlyInteresting] Quality French translation of PUBG on Android
 Isn't Tencent the #1 publisher in China?
If I take the extreme example of the Southern, there are so many late and canceled trains that it has become a running joke in London.
The tories are against yes but not necessarily their entire voting base given the percentage that wants renationalization.
 So personally I have a Redmi Note 3 Pro using Nitrogen OS (Android 8.1.0).
For last year's Redmi (Redmi Note 4 etc.)
you already have a big community with the usual ROMs (LineageOS, Resurrection Remix, etc.), now for this year's generation it'll take a little while.
Otherwise, like for most constructors you will need to unlock your phone's bootloader, then install a ROM recovery before you can install an alternative rom.
Yiiiikes, the title of this article.
When you put your quote in context, there's really nothing to be by offended in this: "I never hesitate to speak either in French, or in the language of the host country, or even in English when it's on an international stage or in front of business circles, because I think it strengthens the Francophonie."
It's a very click-bait title.
Feminist-reactionary camouflage, user manual
Daniel Schneiderman is in front of his screen.
He is preparing to watch a courteous, excellent and intelligent program produced by his new favorite media.
When suddenly, one of the guests is allowed to make a Foucauldian assumption.

He unsheaths an editorial.
Who is this woman who dares to talk about the body of women, March 8, in the context of a show that could not avoid avoiding the hashtag MeToo (not Balance ton Porc, I'll let you guess why; do you have 2h)?
Who is this traitor who suddenly abandons the usual cliches?
Could she be a servant of eviiiiiiiil?
Super-Schneiderman investigates for us!
And yes, poor unfortunate leftists who just wanted to confirm your bias: a person is hiding behind Marianne Durano.
Who? Eugénie Bastié. Yes, Eugénie Bastié, you read correctly.
The eviiiiiiiiil in the flesh has infiltrated our happy plateau.
How? Marianne Durano and Eugénie Bastié work for the same journal.
They are therefore one and the same person, one and the same idea, no autonomy of thought is possible.
On March 8, one woman hides another.
Neither does she hide Paul Piccaretta the managing editor, nor Pierre Chausse, the director of the publication, nor Gauthier Bès, the deputy director, no Fabrice Hadjadj or Olivier Rey the editorial advisors, nor any of the other members.
She doesn't replace Foucauld either, whose theories she takes up again.
No, she slyly replaces Eugenie Bastié because she has the merit of being unknown to the battalion.
Bastié would never have been invited, she is not leftist, but we are sure she would have said exactly the same shiiiiiiit.
Out of concern for journalistic objectivity, with an undeniable taste for contradictory debate, Daniel Schneiderman does justice to women by denouncing such camouflaged sows.
Thank you Daniel Schneiderman for this great step forward on March 8th.
Thank you for your incessant fight for freedom of expression and pluralism in the media.
On a white background? It's the one I have!
I got it by chance when I was a youngster and I wanted to read The Call of Cthulhu.
My parents took me to a bookstore and asked me which one I wanted.
As a good teen who was a little silly and not very bright I said ""Ben en bouquin"" (implying a book).
The bookseller brings us Volume 1 of the Bouquin collection.
Best misunderstanding of my life, I left again and then I left with the complete Lovecraft.
(Someone bought me volumes 2 and 3 a little later).
Here you are ...
I had to look up what the Touch Bar was. 
I'm not up-to-date anymore :(
And damn I had not seen the price go up either...
Damn it, I'd almost have to go into debt to replace my computer, wtf.
For me, I generally say sod them when it comes to the in-laws and in principle it works with everything...
